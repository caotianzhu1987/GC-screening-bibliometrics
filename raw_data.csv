Compared to end oscopy and other common modalities, X-ray examinations have the significant. advantage that they can be performed not only by radiologists but also by radiology technicians. However, the diagnosis of gastric X-ray images is very difficult and it has been reported that the diagnostic accuracy of these images is only 85.5%. In this study, we propose a practical diagnosis support system for gastric X-ray images. An important component of our system is the proposed on-line data augmentation strategy named stochastic gastric image augmentation (sGAIA), which stochastically generates various enhanced images of gastric folds in X-ray images. The proposed sGAIA improves the detection performance of the malignant region by 6.9% in F1-score and our system demonstrates promising screening performance for gastric cancer (recall of 92.3% with a precision of 32.4%) from X-ray images in a clinical setting based on Faster R-CNN with ResNet101 networks.",2019,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 4858-4863 Place: Los Angeles, CA Web of Science ID: WOS:000554828704140",,,,gastric cancer; 1259; computer-aided diagnosis; convolutional neural networks; data augmentation; X-ray images,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tests that allow an early diagnosis could lead to an improvement in patient survival. Liquid biopsies (LBs) due to their non-invasive nature as well as low risk are the current focus of cancer research and could be a promising tool for early cancer detection. LB involves the sampling of any biological fluid (e.g., blood, urine, saliva) to enrich and analyze the tumor's biological material. LBs can detect tumor-associated components such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), extracellular vesicles (EVs), and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). These components can reflect the status of the disease and can facilitate clinical decisions. LBs offer a unique and new way to assess cancers at all stages of treatment, from cancer screenings to prognosis to management of multidisciplinary therapies. In this review, we will provide insights into the current status of the various types of LBs enabling early detection and monitoring of GI cancers and their use in in vitro diagnostics.",Apr-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,1924,,7,15,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 39 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000970600100001,,,,COLORECTAL-CANCER; GASTRIC-CANCER; gastrointestinal cancer; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; PANCREATIC-CANCER; CIRCULATING TUMOR-CELLS; FREE DNA; liquid biopsy; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; circulating tumor cells (CTCs); circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); EDUCATED PLATELETS; FUNCTIONAL IMPLICATIONS; organoids; tumor exosomes; tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs); 230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the role of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) in tumorigenesis remains controversial. We aim to explore its biological function in gastric cancer. Genomes analysis based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset was used to find the differential gene expression between different tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages of gastric cancer. IHC was used to determine the relationship between SFRP4 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics in patients with gastric cancer. The influence of SFRP4 on tumor progression was evaluated by CCK-8, colony formation, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle in vitro, as well as xenograft model in vivo. The methylation status of SFRPs was examined in gastric cancer specimens by quantitative methylation analysis. SFRP4 was most upregulated in advanced gastric cancer. High intratumoral SFRP4 expression, which was associated with tumor invasion and metastasis, was also a poor prognostic indicator for patients with gastric cancer. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that SFRP4 could promote tumor growth; however, IWR-1 could suppress tumor growth mediated by SFRP4 overexpression. Mechanistic exploration found that SFRP4 was overexpressed by the decrease of promoter methylation and thus could competitively antagonize the inhibitory effect of SFRP1 on Wnt pathway activation and tumor progression in gastric cancer.",Sep-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,1454-1464,,9,19,,Mol.

Main research focuses in this field include automated identification of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and detection of early gastric cancers. By helping endoscopists avoid missing and mischaracterizing neoplastic change in both the esophagus and the stomach, these technologies potentially contribute to solving current limitations of gastroscopy. Currently, optical diagnosis of early-stage dysplasia related to Barrett's esophagus can be precisely achieved only by endoscopists proficient in advanced endoscopic imaging, and the false-negative rate for detecting gastric cancer is approximately 10%. Ideally, these novel technologies should work during real-time gastroscopy to provide on-site decision support for endoscopists regardless of their skill; however, previous studies of these topics remain ex vivo and experimental in design. Therefore, the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of CAD for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in clinical practice remain unknown, although a considerable number of pilot studies have been conducted by both engineers and medical doctors with excellent results.

Linked color imaging (LCI) produces bright images in the distant view and is performed for the same screening indications as WLI. LCI and blue laser imaging (BLI) provide excellent visibility of gastric cancers in high color contrast with respect to the surrounding tissue. The characteristic purple and green color of metaplasias on LCI and BLI, respectively, serve to increase the contrast while visualizing gastric cancers regardless of a history of Helicobacter pylori eradication. LCI facilitates color-based recognition of early gastric cancers of all morphological types, including flat lesions or those in an H. pylori-negative normal background mucosa as well as the diagnosis of inflamed mucosae including erosions. LCI reveals changes in mucosal color before the appearance of morphological changes in various gastric lesions. BLI is superior to LCI in the detection of early esophageal cancers and abnormal findings of microstructure and microvasculature in close-up views of upper gastrointestinal cancers. Excellent images can also be obtained with transnasal endoscopy. Using a combination of these modalities allows one to obtain images useful for establishing a diagnosis.

Our study aims to delineate the bidirectional relationship between plasma metabolites and GC and find potential metabolic pathways. We undertook a bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship, specificity, and direction of association between 1400 plasma metabolites and GC. The GWAS data for metabolites was obtained from a cohort of 8299 European individuals. And the GC's GWAS data was from FinnGen Consortium with 2384 European individuals, and the GWAS catalog with 1029 European ancestry cases for validation. Causal estimates were primarily calculated by the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. To ensure robustness, we performed comprehensive sensitivity analyses to assess heterogeneity and address concerns regarding horizontal pleiotropy. We validated the forward relationship between metabolites and GC from another database and implemented meta-analysis. Furthermore, we conducted metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis of these causal metabolites using MetaboAnalyst5.0/6.0 with the database of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. All statistical analysis was carried out using R software. Metabolites like 2s, 3R-dihydroxybutyrate, 4-acetamidobutanoate, ferulic acid 4-sulfate and methyl indole-3-acetate was proven positively linked with the development of GC. Asparagine, glucose to maltose ratio, glycohyocholate, Gulonate levels, linoleoyl ethanolamide and Spermidine to (N(1) + N(8))-acetylspermidine ratio was proven to be negatively associated with GC. Moreover, linoleic acid, histidine, glutamine, bilirubin, Succinate to proline ratio were found to be potentially linked to the development of GC. Furthermore, our analysis identified 18 significant metabolic pathways, including Arginine and proline metabolism (P < .009) and Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis (P < .031). Our findings offer evidence supporting potential casual relations between multiple plasma metabolites and GC. These findings may offer great potential for future application of these biomarkers in GC screening and clinical prevention strategies.",2024/11/29,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:50,,e40612,,48,103,,Medicine (Baltimore),,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 12 Place: Philadelphia Publisher: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Web of Science ID: WOS:001367671300015,,,,RISK; BIOLOGY; BLOOD METABOLITES; gastric cancer; M2; Mendelian randomization; NITRIC-OXIDE; plasma metabolome; PROLINE METABOLISM; PYRUVATE-KINASE; sensitivity; 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On LCI, the lesion was highlighted as an orangish, flat lesion shown to be purple-colored in its central area, surrounded by lavender-colored tissue. Endoscopic submucosal dissection performed led to the patient being diagnosed with tubular adenocarcinoma, well-differentiated type (tub1), pT1a (M).

By using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay we determined the methylation status of three selected genes ZIC1, HOXD10 and RUNX3 in blood samples from patients with GC and precancerous lesions. We discovered that the methylation rate of ZIC1, HOXD10 and RUNX3 increased significantly in the progression of gastric carcinogenesis. Methylation of ZIC1 was associated with positive serum CA19-9, while that of HOXD10 was related to H. pylori status, serum CA19-9 and CEA levels and tumor invasion depth. The Odds ratios (ORs) of ZIC1, HOXD10 and RUNX3 methylation for predicting GC were 4.285 (95% CI: 2.435-7.542), 3.133 (95% CI: 1.700-5.775) and 2.674 (95% CI: 1.441-4.960), while for predicting ""gastric cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia"" (GnI), the ORs were 12.011 (95% CI: 0.050-28.564), 9.174 (95% CI: 3.220-26.135) and 12.794 (95% CI: 4.115-39.778), respectively. In terms of combined detection of these three genes, the sensitivity was 91.6% for GC and 89.8% for GnI, with the highest Youden index in both GC and GnI determination.

OSR1 expression was frequently silenced or down-regulated in gastric cancer cell lines. OSR1 expression was also significantly down-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in primary gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. The silencing or down-regulation of OSR1 was closely associated with promoter hypermethylation. Overexpression of OSR1 significantly inhibited cell growth, arrested the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis in the gastric cancer cell lines AGS, MKN28, and MGC803. Conversely, knockdown of OSR1 by OSR1-short hairpin RNA significantly enhanced cell growth, promoted the cell cycle, and inhibited apoptosis in the normal gastric epithelial cell line GES1. The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that OSR1 activated p53 transcription and repressed the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF). Complementary DNA expression array and western blotting showed that OSR1 increased the expression of nuclear p53, p21, Fas, and death receptor-5, and suppressed the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in the p53 signalling pathway. In addition, OSR1 suppressed the expression of cytoplasmic -catenin, TCF-1, and LEF1 in the Wnt/-catenin signalling pathway. OSR1 methylation was detected in 51.8% of primary gastric cancer patients (85 of 164) by bisulphite genomic sequencing. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that OSR1 methylation was an independent predictor of poor survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that OSR1 methylation was associated with shortened survival in TNM stage I-III patients. In conclusion, OSR1 acts as a functional tumour suppressor through the transcriptional activation of p53 and repression of TCF/LEF in gastric cancer. Detection of OSR1 methylation may serve as a potential biomarker of the early stage of gastric cancer. (c) 2014 The Authors.

BE is the precursor of, and a major recognized risk factor for, developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopy, the current standard for BE detection, is not cost-effective for population screening. We performed genome-wide screening to ascertain regions targeted for recurrent aberrant cytosine methylation in BE, identifying high-frequency methylation within the CCNA1 locus. We tested CCNA1 DNA methylation as a BE biomarker in cytology brushings of the distal esophagus from 173 individuals with or without BE. CCNA1 DNA methylation demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.95 for discriminating BE-related metaplasia and neoplasia cases versus normal individuals, performing identically to methylation of VIM DNA, an established BE biomarker. When combined, the resulting two biomarker panel was 95% sensitive and 91% specific. These results were replicated in an independent validation cohort of 149 individuals who were assayed using the same cutoff values for test positivity established in the training population. To progress toward non-endoscopic esophageal screening, we engineered a well-tolerated, swallowable, encapsulated balloon device able to selectively sample the distal esophagus within 5 min. In balloon samples from 86 individuals, tests of CCNA1 plus VIM DNA methylation detected BE metaplasia with 90.3% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity.

The area under the curve (AUC) of the combined detection of serum EFNA1 and MMP13 for GC was improved (0.794), compared with single biomarker used. Similar results were observed in the validation cohort. Importantly, the combined measurement of serum EFNA1 and MMP13 to detect early-stage GC also had acceptable diagnostic accuracy in training and validation cohort. Combined detection of serum EFNA1 and MMP13 could help identify early-stage GC, suggesting that it may be a promising tool for the early detection of GC.",2024/7/10,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:51,,15957,,1,14,,Sci Rep,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: Berlin Publisher: Nature Portfolio Web of Science ID: WOS:001270506400045,,,,Gastric cancer; PLASMA; EXPRESSION; Serum biomarker; Diagnosis; COLORECTAL-CANCER; Early detection; DNA; EFNA1 and MMP13; 70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asymptomatic adults who underwent upper endoscopy during health checkups at Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center were enrolled. We compared clinicopathologic characteristics of GC according to screening interval (repeated vs. infrequent, annual vs. biennial). After age- and sex-matching, relative risk was computed by hazard ratio (HR) using Cox proportional regression with multivariate adjustment. Of the 58,849 subjects who received screening endoscopy, 277 (0.47%) were found to have GC. Intestinal type comprised 55.4% (102/184) followed by diffuse type (n = 65, 35.3%). Age =50 years, family history and smoking independently increased the risk of GC for both types, whereas male gender [HR = 4.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.728.03] and intestinal metaplasia (IM) (HR = 10.87, 95% CI: 3.3622.30) were significant predictors for intestinal type only. Proportion of early gastric cancer (EGC) was 98.6% (71/72) in annual screening group and 80.7% (46/57) in biennial screening group (p < 0.01). In the former, tumor size was smaller (1.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.8 cm; p < 0.01] and proportion of intramucosal cancer was larger (75.0 vs. 56.1%; p = 0.04). Endoscopic resection was performed more frequently in annual screening group (56.9 vs. 33.3%; p = 0.02). IM along with male gender and older age was a strong risk factor for intestinal type GC.

GC serum autoantibodies were discovered and validated using serum samples from independent patient cohorts encompassing 1,401 participants divided into three groups, i. e. healthy, GC patients, and GC-related disease group. To discover biomarkers for GC, the human proteome microarray was first applied to screen specific autoantibodies in a total of 87 serum samples from GC patients and healthy controls. Potential biomarkers were identified via a statistical analysis protocol. Targeted protein microarrays with only the potential biomarkers were constructed and used to validate the candidate biomarkers using 914 samples. To provide further validation, the abundance of autoantibodies specific to the biomarker candidates was analyzed using enzymelinked immunosorbent assays. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the serum biomarkers. Finally, the efficacy of prognosis efficacy of the final four biomarkers was evaluated by analyzing the clinical records.

The pathogenesis is thought to be due to increased membrane rigidity and reduced red blood cell elasticity, which predisposes the patient to hemolysis and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. In this article, we discuss a Russian engineer who worked aboard a petroleum tanker that presented from his ship with profound B-12 deficiency, microangiopathic anemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, low haptoglobin, and reticulocyte count in the setting of normal renal and neurologic function. The patient traveled around the world seven months of the year for work and had occupational exposure to fluorinated hydrocarbons. Extensive diagnostic work-up, including endoscopic biopsy, and a radio-labeled octreotide scan was performed. The patient was found to have autoimmune gastritis and a gastric carcinoid tumor. With assistance from his global health insurance provider and a local hospital near his hometown in Russia, care was coordinated to be transitioned there with a plan for repeat endoscopy and mapping biopsies to determine the extent of his tumor burden. This study adds to the now growing base of literature describing this atypical presentation of pernicious anemia with normal neurologic function and underscores the importance of screening for B-12 deficiency in these patients. It also highlights the increased risk of gastric carcinoids in patients with autoimmune gastritis.

Artificial intelligence techniques, especially deep learning algorithms with convolutional neural networks, might help endoscopists identify the precancerous lesions and reduce interobserver variability. In this review, a systematic literature search was undertaken of the Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase, with an emphasis on the deep learning-based diagnosis of precancerous lesions in the upper GI tract. The status of deep learning algorithms in upper GI precancerous lesions has been systematically summarized. The challenges and recommendations targeting this field are comprehensively analyzed for future research.",2021/5/28,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:59,,2531-2544,,20,27,,World J.

All specimens were fixed in 15% buffered neutral pH formaldehyde and paraffin embedded. Histological sections were stained using current techniques: Hematoxylin-Eosin, trichromic van Gieson, Giemsa (for Helicobacter pylori) and Alcian blue, pH 1 and 2.5 (for acid and sulfated mucins). We used Lauren histological classification with two main types of gastric carcinoma: intestinal and diffuse.; RESULTS: From 1,201 gastric endobiopsies, we diagnosed gastric carcinoma in 257 patients (21.3%) and only four of them were EGCs, although their endoscopical examination was negative for gastric tumor. Among these malignant proliferations, three cases showed intestinal type EGC and one case was diffuse type EGC. The additional endobiopsies fragments presented chronic atrophic gastritis with H. pylori infection, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia.; CONCLUSIONS: EGC had an incidence of 0.34%, which is very low because the lack of an endoscopical screening program favors the diagnosis of gastric cancer in advanced stages. Both histological types--intestinal and diffuse, were present in EGC, associated with H. pylori chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. The presence of dysplasia recommends the endoscopical surveillance of these patients.",2006,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:22,,,,3,47,,Rom. J. Morphol. Embryol. = Rev. Roum. Morphol.

While this early-phase drug tolerance is known to be related to the stem cell-like characteristic of persister cells, how the stem cell-related pathways contribute to drug resistance has remained elusive. Here, we conducted a single-cell analysis based on the stem cell lineage-related and gastric cell lineage-related gene expression in patient-derived gastric cancer cell models. The analyses revealed that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) induces a dynamic change in the cell heterogeneity. In particular, cells highly expressing stem cell-related genes were enriched in the residual cancer cells after 5-FU treatment. Subsequent functional screening identified aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3 (ALDH1A3) as a specific marker and potential therapeutic target of persister cells. ALDH1A3 was selectively overexpressed among the ALDH isozymes after treatment with 5-FU or SN38, a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. Attenuation of ALDH1A3 expression by RNA interference significantly suppressed cell proliferation, reduced the number of persister cells after anticancer drug treatment and interfered with tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, ALDH1A3 depletion affected gene expression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cell survival pathway, which coincided with a decrease in the activating phosphorylation of S6 kinase. Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, reduced the number of 5FU-tolerant persister cells. High ALDH1A3 expression correlated with worse prognosis of gastric cancer patients. These observations indicate that the ALDH1A3-mTOR axis could be a novel therapeutic target to eradicate drug-tolerant gastric cancer cells.",Mar-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:03,,962-973,,3,111,,Cancer Sci.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 12 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000518281000019,,,,IDENTIFICATION; gastric cancer; SURVIVAL; MARKER; STOMACH; STEM-CELLS; drug tolerance; persister cells; SELF-RENEWAL; tumor heterogeneity; 604,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated whether M2 macrophages participate in the development of peritoneal dissemination in gastric cancer. The characteristics of peritoneal macrophages in gastric cancer patients with or without peritoneal dissemination were examined by flow cytometry and the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of M2 macrophages on phenotypic changes of the gastric cancer cell line MKN45 were assessed with a direct or indirect co-culture system in vitro and an in vivo mouse xenograft model. The number of peritoneal macrophages with the M2 phenotype (CD68(+)CD163(+) or CD68(+)CD204(+)) was significantly higher in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal dissemination than in those without peritoneal dissemination. Higher expression of the M2-related messenger RNAs (IL-10, vascular endothelial growth factor A, vascular endothelial growth factor C, matrix metalloproteinase 1, and amphiregulin) and lower expression of M1-related messenger RNAs (TNF-alpha, CD80, CD86, and IL-12p40) were also confirmed in the TAMs. Macrophage co-culture with gastric cancer cells converted M1 phenotype into M2 phenotype. Moreover, the coexistence of MKN45 cells with M2 macrophages resulted in cancer cell proliferation and an acceleration of tumor growth in the xenograft model. Intraperitoneal TAMs in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal dissemination were polarized to the M2 phenotype, and could contribute to tumor proliferation and progression.

TGF-beta receptor 2 (TGF beta R2) contains a kinase domain that phosphorylates and activates the downstream of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Our previous microarray analysis revealed marked changes in miR-181a expression in gastric cancers, and the bioinformatics analysis suggested that miR-181a negatively regulated TGF beta R2. In order to verify the effect of miR-181a on TGF beta R2 and clarify the influence of miR-181a on the migration and proliferation of gastric cancer, studies in gastric cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models were carried out. We found that a reduced expression of TGF beta R2 and an increased expression miR-181a in gastric cancer tissues compared to adjacent noncancerous tissues. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that TGF beta R2 was a target of miR-181a. In addition, we found that miR-181a mimics, which increased the level of miR-181a, downregulated the expression of TGF beta R2 in the gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901. Moreover, both the overexpression of miR-181a and the downregulation of TGF beta R2 promoted the migration and proliferation of SGC-7901 cells. Conversely, SGC-7901 cell migration and proliferation were inhibited by the downregulation of miR-181a and the overexpression of TGF beta R2. Furthermore, the increased expression of miR-181a and the decreased expression of TGF beta R2 also enhanced the tumor growth in mice bearing gastric cancer. Our results herein indicated that miR-181a promoted the migration and proliferation of gastric cancer cells by downregulating TGF beta R2 at the posttranscriptional level.

Next, a total of 1446 cases were collected, with 896 cases in GC, 322 in benign gastric disease and 228 in healthy controls.

Surgical and/or biopsy specimens are generally used to understand the tumor-associated alterations; however, those approaches cannot always be performed because of their invasive characteristics and may fail to reflect current tumor dynamics and drug sensitivities, which may change during the therapeutic process. Therefore, the importance of developing a non-invasive biomarker with the ability to monitor real-time tumor dynamics should be emphasized. This concept, so called ""liquid biopsy"", would provide an ideal therapeutic strategy for an individual cancer patient and would facilitate the development of ""tailor- made"" cancer management programs. In the blood of cancer patients, the presence and potent utilities of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free nucleic acids ( cfNAs) such as DNA, mRNA and microRNA have been recognized, and their clinical relevance is attracting considerable attention. In this review, we discuss recent developments in this research field as well as the relevance and future perspectives of CTCs and cfNAs in cancer patients, especially focusing on GC.

PGII and CA199 in early gastric cancer. Sixty cases of gastric cancer patients admitted to our hospital from December 2019 to December 2020 were selected as the gastric cancer group and 80 cases of healthy volunteers who underwent physical examination in our hospital during the same period were selected as the healthy group. All the 60 patients underwent MRI-DWI examination, and the pathological diagnosis results were regarded as the gold standard. MRI-DWI images, MRI-DWI signal intensity values of patients with different degrees of gastric cancer differentiation. Serum PGI, PGII and CA199 levels of subjects in the two groups were compared. AUC was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of MRI-DWI signal intensity value combined with serum PGI, PG II and CA199 for early gastric cancer. In the healthy group, T1W1 showed relatively uniform low signal intensity. While T2WI showed no significant increase in signal intensity. In the gastric cancer group. There was diffuse gastric wall thickening, local thickening or mass formation; T1WI and WATS showed slightly lower signal intensity in the lesion area. T2WI, FLAIR and B-TFE showed slightly uneven or moderately increased signal intensity. DWI showed limited diffusion, and the signal intensity increased uniformly or more uniformly, and the range of increase was clear. The signal intensity of MRI-DWI was 89.12 +/- 8.14 in patients with low differentiation, 82.17 +/- 6.35 in patients with moderate differentiation, and 74.52 +/- 4.53 in patients with high differentiation. There were significant differences in the signal intensity of MRI-DWI among the three groups, and the difference was statistically significant (F=12.214, P <0.05). Serum PGI levels of subjects in the gastric cancer group were significantly lower than those in the healthy group, and the levels of PGII and CA199 were significantly higher than that in the healthy group, with statistical significance (P <0.05). The AUC, sensitivity and specificity of MRI-DWI signal intensity value and serum PGI, PGII and CA199 combined indexes in the diagnosis of gastric cancer were significantly higher than those of the independent indexes, with statistical significance (P <0.05). Conclusion: MRI-DWI signal strength value, serum PGI, PGII and CA199 levels are closely related to the occurrence and development of early gastric cancer. The combined detection and diagnosis efficiency is higher, which is helpful to improve the detection rate of early gastric cancer and is worthy of extensive clinical application.",2021,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:00,,95-100,,2,67,,Cell.

The subjects were defined as participants aged 40-79 years who had no gastric cancer screening in the previous year. Follow-up of mortality was continued from the date of the first screening to the date of death or up to December 31, 2013. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of gastric cancer incidence, gastric cancer death, all cancer deaths except gastric cancer death, and all-causes death except gastric cancer death.

The accuracy of cytological diagnosis leaves room for improvement; therefore, highly sensitive molecular diagnostics, such as an enzyme immunoassay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and virus-guided imaging, have been developed to detect minute cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity.

There is a high unmet need for early detection approaches for diffuse gastric cancer (DGC). We examined whether the stool proteome of mouse models of gastric cancer (GC) and individuals with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) have utility as biomarkers for early detection. Proteomic mass spectrometry of the stool of a genetically engineered mouse model driven by oncogenic KrasG12D and loss of p53 and Cdh1 in gastric parietal cells [known as Triple Conditional (TCON) mice] identified differentially abundant proteins compared with littermate controls. Immunoblot assays validated a panel of proteins, including actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2 (ASAH2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and valosin-containing protein (VCP), as enriched in TCON stool compared with littermate control stool. Immunofluorescence analysis of these proteins in TCON stomach sections revealed increased protein expression compared with littermate controls. Proteomic mass spectrometry of stool obtained from patients with HDGC with CDH1 mutations identified increased expression of ASAH2, DPP4, VCP, lactotransferrin (LTF), and tropomyosin-2 relative to stool from healthy sex- and age-matched donors. Chemical inhibition of ASAH2 using C6 urea ceramide was toxic to GC cell lines and GC patient-derived organoids. This toxicity was reversed by adding downstream products of the S1P synthesis pathway, which suggested a dependency on ASAH2 activity in GC. An exploratory analysis of the HDGC stool microbiome identified features that correlated with patient tumors.

Genes associated with paraptosis were identified from the references and subjected to Cox regression analysis in the TCGA-STAD cohort. Using machine learning models, LPAR1 consistently ranked highest in feature importance. Multiple sequencing data showed that LPAR1 was significantly overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). LPAR1 expression was significantly higher in normal tissues, and ROC analysis demonstrated its discriminative ability. Copy number alterations and microsatellite instability were significantly associated with LPAR1 expression. High LPAR1 expression correlated with advanced tumor grades and specific cancer immune subtypes, and multivariate analysis confirmed LPAR1 as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. LPAR1 expression was associated with different immune response metrics, including immune effector activation and upregulated chemokine secretion. High LPAR1 expression also correlated with increased sensitivity to compounds, such as BET bromodomain inhibitors I-BET151 and RITA, suggesting LPAR1 as a biomarker for predicting drug activity. FOXP2 showed a strong positive correlation with LPAR1 transcriptional regulation, while increased methylation of LPAR1 promoter regions was negatively correlated with gene expression. Knockdown of LPAR1 affected cell growth in most tumor cell lines, and in vitro experiments demonstrated that LPAR1 influenced extracellular matrix (ECM) contraction and cell viability in the paraptosis of CAFs. These findings suggest that LPAR1 is a critical regulator of paraptosis in GC and a potential biomarker for drug sensitivity and immunotherapy response. This underscores the role of CAFs in mediating tumorigenic effects and suggests that targeting LPAR1 could be a promising strategy for precision medicine in GC.",Nov-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:51,,102110,,102110,49,,Transl.

The upregulated DEGs were enriched in regulation of microvillus length and phospholipid binding and were components of the apical plasma membrane. Downregulated DEGs were involved in digestion and hormone activity and were found in the extracellular space. Fat digestion and absorption as well as gastric acid secretion were the pathways enrichment. The most important gene modules related mainly to O-glycan processing, extracellular exosome, hormone activity, and vitamin and fat digestion and absorption. Eleven hub genes were identified, of which APOB, FABP1, CDX2, GCG, HNF4A, SLC26A3, CFTR, MUC5AC, OLFM4, and SI were related to the prognosis. Olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4) was the most relevant DEG to identify GIM-GC. In conclusion: DEGs and hub genes are helpful to understand the molecular mechanisms of GIM-GC. OLFM4 may be a biological marker for GIM-GC.",Dec-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:57,,913-926,,6,72,,J. Physiol.

Clinical tissue and serum samples, as well as specimens in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, were used to analyse the expression of LINC00691 in GC. Our data indicated that the expression of LINC00691 in GC was significantly higher than that in healthy controls and was associated with clinicopathological features and survival time. In the GC cell lines MKN-45 and HGC-27, the knockdown of LINC00691 suppressed proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene experiments showed that LINC00691 activated Lin28 transcription. Western blot analysis indicated that the knockdown of LINC00691 contributed to the decreased expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in GC cells. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway inhibitor ruxolitinib effectively suppressed the effects of LINC00691. In addition, both LINC00691 and Lin28 promoted the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Therefore, our study clarified that LINC00691 is highly expressed in GC and is a potential biomarker for GC diagnosis and prognosis. LINC00691 promotes the proliferation and invasion of GC cells by activating Lin28 transcription and facilitating EGF expression through the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, which provides new ideas for targeted therapy of GC.",Jun-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:02,,105751,,105751,123,,Int.

To establish the quality of the evidence and the levels of recommendation, we used the methodology based on the GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We obtained a consensus among experts using a Delphi method. The document evaluates different measures to improve the quality of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in this setting and makes recommendations on how to evaluate and treat the identified lesions. We recommend that upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for surveillance of GCPL should be performed by endoscopists with adequate training, administering oral premedication and use of sedation. To improve the identification of GCPL, we recommend the use of high definition endoscopes and conventional or digital chromoendoscopy and, for biopsies, NBI should be used to target the most suspicious areas of intestinal metaplasia. Regarding the evaluation of visible lesions, the risk of submucosal invasion should be evaluated with magnifying endoscopes and endoscopic ultrasound should be reserved for those with suspected deep invasion. In lesions amenable to endoscopic resection, submucosal endoscopic dissection is considered the technique of choice. (C) 2021 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Gastric cancer is a common and deadly malignancy, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. Conventional endoscopy has limitations in accurately diagnosing gastric cancer, and therefore, there is a need for alternative approaches. This paper discusses the potential of using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms based on MRI for automatic annotation and extraction of lesion information from gastroscopic images. Various deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been utilized for image processing and classification of gastric mucosal lesions. These models have shown promising results in terms of sensitivity and specificity, demonstrating comparable diagnostic performance to human experts in certain conditions. Additionally, object detection algorithms like Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN have been employed for the detection and segmentation of gastric cancer regions in endoscopic images, further improving diagnostic accuracy. The application of MRI-based deep learning models in the detection and diagnosis of gastric cancer can potentially enhance early cancer detection, reduce misdiagnosis rates, and ultimately improve patient survival rates. These AI-assisted models can assist endoscopists in identifying early cancerous changes, selecting personalized treatment plans, and evaluating treatment effectiveness.",2024,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 418-425 Place: Ningbo, PEOPLES R CHINA Web of Science ID: WOS:001304539800056",,,,gastric cancer; automatic annotation; deep learning models; image classification; MRI; 151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMPORTANCE Noninvasive detection of early-stage disease is a key strategy for reducing gastric cancer (GC)-associated patient mortality. OBJECTIVE To establish a novel, noninvasive, microRNA (miRNA)-based signature for the early detection of GC using a comprehensive biomarker discovery approach with retrospective and prospective validation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This diagnostic study was conducted in 4 phases using publicly available genome sequences and tissue samples from patients at an academic medical center in Japan, and validated with retrospective multicenter cohorts of patients with GC. Three tissue miRNA data sets were used to identify a miRNA signature that discriminated GC vs normal tissues. The robustness of this signature was assessed in serum from 2 retrospective cohorts of patients with GC. A risk-scoring model was derived, then the performance of the miRNA signature was evaluated in a prospective cohort of patients with GC. The robustness of the miRNA signature was compared with current blood-based markers, and a cost-effectiveness analysis of the miRNA signature against the current practice of endoscopy was performed. All clinical samples used for this study were collected and data analyzed between April 1997 and March 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Assessment of diagnostic efficiency on the basis of area under the curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity. RESULTS The data sets for the genome-wide expression profiling analysis stage included 598 total patient samples (284 [55.4%] from men; mean [SE] patient age, 65.7 [0.5] years). The resulting 10-miRNA signature was validated in 2 retrospective GC serum cohorts (586 patients; 348 [59.4%] men, mean [SE] age, 66.0 [0.7] years), which led to the establishment of a 5-miRNA signature (AUC, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.94) that also exhibited high levels of diagnostic performance in patients with stage I disease (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.94). A risk-scoring model was derived and the assay was optimized to a minimal number of miRNAs. The performance of the resulting 3-miRNA signature was then validated in a prospective cohort of patients with GC (349 patients; 124 [70.5%] men, median [range] age, 66.0 [0.66] years). The final 3-miRNA signature (miR-18a, miR-181b, and miR-335) exhibited high diagnostic accuracy in all stages of patients (AUC, 0.86; 95% CI 0.83-0.90), including in patients with stage I disease (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.91). Furthermore, this miRNA signature was superior to currently used blood markers and outperformed the endoscopic screening in a cost-effectiveness analysis (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, CNY yen 16162.5 per quality-adjusted life-year [USD $2304.80 per quality-adjusted life-year]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest the potential clinical significance of the 3-miRNA signature as a noninvasive, cost-effective, and facile assay for the early detection of GC. Question Can circulating microRNAs be used to derive clinically significant noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer? Findings This diagnostic study used a multistep and comprehensive biomarker discovery approach to establish a novel, noninvasive, microRNA-based signature for the early detection of gastric cancer, which was retrospectively and prospectively validated in multicenter patient cohorts. Meaning For patients with gastric cancer and individuals with a high risk for gastric cancer, a microRNA-based signature may improve the early detection of gastric cancer.",2021/8/24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,e2121129,,8,4,,JAMA Netw.

In general, cancer is nothing but the unnatural growth of blood cells in different parts of the body and is named accordingly. It may be skin cancer, breast cancer, uterus cancer, intestinal cancer, stomach cancer, etc. However, every type of cancer consists of unwanted blood cells which cause issues in the body starting from the minor to death. Cancer cells have the common features in them, and these common features we have used in our work for the processing. Cancer has a significant death rate; however, it is frequently curable with simple surgery if detected in its early stages. A quick and correct diagnosis may be extremely beneficial to both doctors and patients. In several medical domains, the latest deep-learning-based model's performance is comparable to or even exceeds that of human specialists. We have proposed a novel methodology based on a convolutional neural network that may be used for almost all types of cancer detection. We have collected different datasets of different types of common cancer from different sources and used 90% of the sample data for the training purpose, then we reduced it by 10%, and an 80% image set was used for the validation of the model. After that for testing purposes, we fed a sample dataset and obtain the results.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the yield of OGD in patients with positive FITs. A retrospective review of patients who underwent colonoscopy for a positive FIT between Jan. 2008 and Dec. 2012 was identified from a prospectively collected endoscopy database at the National University Hospital, Singapore. Patients who underwent concurrent or subsequent OGDs for positive FIT formed the study group. We considered any new cancer or significant upper gastrointestinal pathology such as peptic ulcer disease or gastritis requiring treatment as a positive examination. A total of 202 patients underwent both a colonoscopy and an OGD for a positive FIT and formed the study group. One hundred and six (52.5 %) of them had a positive examination with gastritis and duodenitis representing the most common UGI pathology in 89 (44.1 %) patients. Twenty-nine (14.4 %) patients tested positive for helicobacter pylori infection and another 16 (7.9 %) patients had peptic ulcer disease. There were no UGI cancers detected. One patient had an esophageal leiomyoma that was treated conservatively. Routine gastroscopy for FIT positivity has a high diagnostic yield for benign upper gastrointestinal pathology.

The utilization of HER-1 and CA 125 as screening biomarkers for the anticipation of early-stage cancer and monitoring cancer progression is expanding due to the invasive and costly nature of present techniques. In this study, a novel stochastic sensor was developed for the simultaneous determination of HER-1 and CA 125 in whole blood, saliva, and gastric tumor tissue samples using a fast, easy, inexpensive, and portable method. The stochastic sensor was prepared by electropolymerization of cysteine on the surface of the Au-TiO2@rGO/SPCE sensor. The Au-TiO2@rGO nanocomposite was synthesized using a simple chemical reduction process. The proposed sensor showed wide linear concentration ranges and very low limits of quantification (LOQ). The concentration ranges were from 3.9 x 10(-14) to 3.9 x 10(-8) mu g mL(-1), with a LOQ of 3.9 x 10(-14) mu g mL(-1) for HER-1. For CA 125, the concentration ranges were from 8.3 x 10(-14) to 8.3 x 10(-10) U mL(-1), with a LOQ of 8.3 x 10(-14) U mL(-1). Both biomarkers exhibit precise discrimination in different biological samples, with recoveries above 96.78% and RSD values below 0.04%. With a confidence level of 99%, the Student t-test revealed that there is no statistically significant difference between the outcomes obtained by using the poly-Cys/Au-TiO2@rGO/SPCE sensor for screening examinations of biological samples.

Thus, it is expected that gastric cancer will be detected earlier, and gastric cancer mortality further decreased, with the widespread use of endoscopy and Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. However, due to an increasingly aging population and relatively low gastric cancer screening rates, gastric cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in Japan. While the era of endoscopic gastric cancer screening has begun, it does present challenges, such as limited/varying regional availability of endoscopists. This review describes the history of gastric cancer screening in Japan, achievements in endoscopic gastric cancer screening in Japan and Korea, efforts underway to improve screening by stratifying individuals according to gastric cancer risk, and initiatives by the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society aimed at improving screening, including the implementation of a board certification program for screening endoscopists.",Mar-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,412-419,,3,34,,Dig.

This multicenter, population-based cohort study conducted in seven areas in China aimed to assess the correlation between current H. pylori infection and the severity of UGI lesions, as well as its association with the risk of gastric cancer (GC) and esophageal cancer (EC). From 2015 to 2017, 27,085 participants (aged 40-69) completed a standardized questionnaire, and underwent a C-13-urea breath test. Then a subset underwent UGI endoscopy to assess the UGI lesion detection rates. All individuals were followed up until December 2021 to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) for UGI cancers. H. pylori infection prevalence was 45.9%, and among endoscopy participants, 22.2% had gastric lesions, 19.2% had esophageal lesions. Higher detection rates of gastric lesions were noted in the H. pylori-positive population across all lesion severity levels. Over a median follow-up of 6.3 years, 104 EC and 179 GC cases were observed, including 103 non-cardia gastric cancer (NCGC) cases and 76 cardia gastric cancer (CGC) cases. H. pylori-infected individuals exhibited a 1.78-fold increased risk of GC (HR 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-2.40) but no significant increase in EC risk (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.73-1.57). Notably, there was a higher risk for both NCGC and CGC in H. pylori-infected individuals. This population-based cohort study provides valuable evidence supporting the association between current H. pylori infection and the risk of both NCGC and CGC. These findings contribute to the empirical basis for risk stratification and recommendations for UGI cancer screening.",2024/10/1,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:51,,1203-1211,,7,155,,Int. J.

Serum samples from 168 gastric cancer patients and 50 matched controls were collected and exosomal RNAs were extracted. After that, miR-590-5p is analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which is more related to clinical and pathological parameters and patient monitoring data. MGC-803 and HGC-27 cells were treated by miR-590-5p mimics, and then the changes of cell fluidity and invasiveness were monitored. The results showed that the expression level of miR-590-5p in exosomes of healthy observation group, early (I and II) stage group, and late stage (III) group was 30.34 +/- 6.35, 6.19 +/- 0.81, and 2.9 +/- 0.19, respectively (all p < 0.05).

The expression of exosomal miR-590-5p in serum was related to clinical stage (p = 0.008), infiltration depth, and the expression level of ki-67 (p < 0.001). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the decrease of explicit level of exosomal miR-590-5p was related to the decrease of overall survival rate (p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that miR-590-5p can be used as an independent predictor. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-590-5p inhibited cell migration and invasion in MGC-803 cells and HGC-27 cells. The serum expression level of exosomal miR-590-5p may be a biomarker, which is potentially useful and noninvasive for early detection and prediction of GC.

Early gastric cancer, whereby disease is limited to mucosa and submucosa, confers a survival rate of greater than 90% in 5 years in many centres. Gastric cancer is still a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide. In high incidence areas such as Japan, screening of asymptomatic population has been advocated. However, in Western countries, mass screening is not cost-effective. Hence, strategy has been directed to screen symptomatic individuals who are at higher risk of gastric cancer. Most patients with early gastric cancer present with symptoms indistinguishable from benign peptic ulcer disease. Screening for this group of patients improves detection rate of early gastric cancer and therefore its prognosis. Endoscopy for surveillance of premalignant lesions has been explored with this objective in mind. Serology testing for biomarkers such as pepsinogen, anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody and gastrin has been studied as an alternative to endoscopy. There is compelling evidence for the role of H. pylori in the initiation of Correa's cascade (stepwise progression from chronic active gastritis, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and finally adenocarcinoma). Regression of premalignant lesions has been demonstrated with H. pylori eradication.

GCAE has characteristic features, and we must understand these features in endoscopic examinations. Differentiated cancer types were frequently found after eradication and included characteristic endoscopic features such as reddish depression (RD).

Recently, we clarified similar alterations in genetic mutations between ELA and gastric cancer, suggesting that ELA is derived from gastric cancer.

The role of Trop2 in promoting EMT in GC cells was examined by a variety of experimental assays. Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanism of Trop2 in promoting EMT was studied by in vivo and in vitro assays. The Trop2 expression in relation to tumor metastasis status was detected by IHC in 248 cases of GC tissues and 86 cases of matched adjacent tissues. Trop2 promoted the metastasis and induces EMT in GC. Meanwhile, the elevated protein levels of Trop2 and mesenchymal markers were also found in the TGF-beta 1-induced EMT model in GC cells. Importantly, Trop2 physically bound and activated beta-catenin to promote EMT; moreover, Trop2 increased the accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus to accelerate metastasis in GC cells. Inhibition of Trop2 expression in GC cells prevented the migration and invasion of GC cells in vivo. Trop2+/vimentin+ expression was higher in GC tissues than that in matched adjacent tissues, and Trop2+/vimentin+ expression in GC was associated with the differentiation, TNM stage, and distant metastases. These sets of data reveal a novel regulatory network of Trop2 in EMT and GC metastasis, suggesting Trop2 as a useful marker for inducing EMT and metastasis of GC, which may help to lead a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the GC.",Mar-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,1135-1147,,3,8,,Cancer Med.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 13 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000462347500028,,,,METASTASIS; gastric cancer; EXPRESSION; COLORECTAL-CANCER; INVASION; CARCINOGENESIS; PROLIFERATION; EMT; SIGNALING PATHWAY; PROGNOSTIC MARKER; beta-catenin; epithelial-mesenchymal transition; PROGRAMS; Trop2; 702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in the GC samples compared with the normal controls. Two-way hierarchical clustering of DEGs was performed to distinguish the normal controls from the GC samples. The co-expression coefficient was analyzed among the DEGs using the data from COXPRESdb. The gene co-expression network was constructed based on the DEGs using Cytoscape software, and modules in the network were analyzed by ClusterOne and Bingo. Furthermore, enrichment analysis of the DEGs in the modules was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. In total, 596 DEGs in the GC samples and 57 co-expression gene pairs were identified. A total of 7 genes were enriched in the same module, for which the function was phosphate transport and which was annotated to participate in the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction pathway. These genes were collagen, type VI, alpha 3 (COL6A3), COL1A2, COL1A1, COL5A2, thrombospondin 2, COL11A1 and COL5A1.

Herein, we employed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to determine the serum proteome signatures and related pathways in individuals with gastric precancerous (pre-GC) lesions and GC and explore the effect of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Differentially expressed proteins in GC and pre-GC compared with non-atrophic gastritis (NAG) group were identified. APOA4, a protein associated with metaplastic differentiation, and COMP, an extracellular matrix protein, were increased in the serum of patients with pre-GC lesions and GC. In addition, several inflammation-associated proteins, such as component C3, were decreased in the GC and pre-GC groups, which highlight a tendency for the inflammatory response to converge at the gastric lesion site during the GC cascade. Moreover, the abundance of proteins associated with oxidant detoxification was higher in the GC group compared with that in the NAG group, and these proteins were also increased in the serum of the H. pylori-positive GC group compared with that in the H. pylori-negative GC patients, reflecting the importance of oxidative stress pathways in H. pylori infection. Collectively, the findings of this study highlight pathways that play important roles in GC progression, and may provide potential diagnostic biomarkers for the detection of pre-GC lesions.",2024/3/22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,1252058,,1252058,11,,Front.

The optimal cutoff levels for the NLR and PLR were defined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (NLR=2.258, PLR=147.368). The value of different biomarkers for diagnosing GC was compared by the area under the curve (AUC). The NLR and PLR showed diagnostic sensitivity in GC (AUC=0.715, AUC=0.707). Using the Bonferroni correction, the NLR and PLR were superior to CEA and CA19-9 in the diagnosis of GC (P<0.0001).

We developed the combined restriction digital PCR (CORD) assay, a new methylation assay allowing for the counting of as little as one copy of a methylated gene in a small sample of DNA without necessitating DNA bisulfite treatment. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the serum DNA testing of methylated RUNX3 by the CORD assay for the detection of early gastric cancer using 50 patients with early gastric cancer and 61 control individuals. The CORD assay had a sensitivity of 50.0% and a specificity of 80.3% for early gastric cancer. Methylated RUNX3 copies were significantly associated with tumor size, massive submucosal invasion, and lymph-vascular invasion.

With AI's efficient computational power and learning capacities, endoscopists can improve their diagnostic accuracies and avoid the missing or mischaracterization of gastric neoplastic changes. So far, several AI systems that incorporated both traditional and novel endoscopy technologies have been developed for various purposes, with most systems achieving an accuracy of more than 80%. However, their feasibility, effectiveness, and safety in clinical practice remain to be seen as there have been no clinical trials yet.

Here, a highly robust N-glycoproteomics (HRN) platform comprising an automated enrichment method, a stable microflow LC-MS/MS system, and a sensitive glycopeptide-spectra-deciphering tool is developed for large-scale quantitative N-glycoproteome analysis. The HRN platform is applied to analyze serum N-glycoproteomes of 278 subjects from three cohorts to investigate glycosylation changes of GC. It identifies over 20 000 unique site-specific glycans from discovery and validation cohorts, and determines four site-specific glycans as biomarker candidates. One candidate has branched tetra-antennary structure capping with sialyl-Lewis antigen, and it significantly outperforms serum CEA with AUC values > 0.89 compared against < 0.67 for diagnosing early-stage GC.

In addition, the history of pepsinogen (PG) in research as a gastric cancer biomarker has varied, in that the use of serum levels of PGI and PGII and the PGI/PGII ratio as gastric cancer screening tools was introduced in Japan before 1990, but in Korea the first research results were only reported in 2008.

In 2013 countrywide Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication was approved coupled with endoscopy to assess for the presence of chronic gastritis. Current data support the notion that cure of the infection in those with non-atrophic gastritis will prevent development of gastric cancer. However, while progression to more severe damage is halted in those who have already developed, atrophic gastritis/gastric atrophy remain at risk for subsequent development of gastric cancer. That risk is directly related to the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis. Methods to stratify cancer risk include those based on endoscopic assessment of the atrophic border, histologic grading, and non-invasive methods based on serologic testing of pepsinogen levels. Continued surveillance is required because those with atrophic gastritis/gastric atrophy retain considerable gastric cancer risk even after H. pylori eradication. Those who have already experienced a resectable early gastric cancer are among those at highest risk as metachronous lesions are frequent even after H. pylori eradication. We review the role of H. pylori and effect of H. pylori eradication indicating the incidence and the predictive factors on development of metachronous cancer after endoscopic therapy of early gastric cancer. Studies to refine risk markers to stratify for risk, surveillance methods, intervals, and duration after successful H. pylori eradication, and whether adjuvant therapy would change risk are needed.

However, there are few studies on the prevalence and detection methods of NTRK fusions in GC. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a screening method to select cases for molecular testing and evaluated the effectiveness of IHC, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and nextgeneration sequencing (NGS). We retrospectively collected 1970 patients with GC. Pan-TRK IHC was conducted in all cases, and three cases were positive: one with strong and diffuse cytoplasmic staining, while two with weak cytoplasmic staining. All three cases were validated using NTRK1/2/3 FISH. FISH results revealed a single 3 ' signal of NTRK1 in 95% of the tumor cells in the first case, while the remaining two cases were negative. NGS confirmed LMNA-NTRK1 fusion in the first case, with no gene fusion detected in the other two cases. Out of 46 negative controls, one had a non-functional fusion of IGR-NTRK1, and four had point mutations. The case with LMNA-NTRK1 fusion were negative for pMMR, EBV, HER2, and AFP. The pan-TRK IHC showed a 33.33% (1/3) concordance rate with RNA-based NGS. If the criterion for positivity was 3+ cytoplasmic staining, the agreement between IHC and RNA-based NGS was 100% (1/1). In conclusion, the incidence of NTRK fusion in GC is extremely low (0.05%). If the criteria are strict, pan-TRK IHC is highly effective for screening NTRK fusions. FISH could complement NGS detection, particularly when NTRK fusion is detected by DNA sequencing.

Both normal and cancer cells can generate and secrete exosomes, which are nanosized membrane vesicles that can transport microRNAs and proteins. Emerging evidence indicates that the exosomes secreted by cancer cells can be released into the circulatory system. In this study, we investigated whether circulating exosomal miRNAs can be used to discriminate individuals with GC from healthy controls (NCs). Based on the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), four miRNAs (miR-19b-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-106a-5p) related to GC pathogenesis were identified in serum-circulating exosomes from a cohort of 20 healthy controls and 20 individuals with GC in the initial screening phase. The distinguished miRNAs were further validated in the training (90 GC vs. 90 NCs) and blinded phases 20 GC vs. 20 NCs), and the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of these miRNAs were analyzed. We found that miR-19b and miR-106a were markedly overexpressed in individuals with GC compared to NCs (P < 0.0001). Besides, the ROC analyses yielded the AUC values of 0.786 for miR-106a-5p, 0.769 for miR-19b-3p and combined ROC analysis revealed the highest AUC value of 0.814 in discriminating GC patients from NCs. Furthermore, based on the model developed from the data, a signature composed of the 2 miRNAs (miR-19b-3p and miR-106a-5p) correctly discriminated 19 out of 20 GC serum samples (95% sensitivity) and 18 out of 20 normal samples (90% specificity) in the blinded phase. Moreover, the validated miRNAs were related to GC lymphatic metastasis (P < 0.01) and expressed at higher levels in stages III and IV compared to I and II stages (P < 0.05). These results suggest that serum exosomal miR-19b-3p and miR-106a-5p are novel potential biomarkers for detecting GC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we measured 39 candidate cancer-associated lncRNAs by reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in sera from 110 patients with GC, 106 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects and 15 patients with gastric peptic ulcer, markers were validated and assessed by RT-qPCR. The correlation of the expression levels of the candidate serum lncRNAs with clinical parameters of GC patients was performed. A three-lncRNA signature, including CUDR, LSINCT-5 and PTENP1, was identified that may be potential diagnostic marker for GC. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for this serum three-lncRNA signature were 0.920 and 0.829 for the two sets of serum samples. Moreover, a risk model for the serum three-lncRNA signature demonstrated that healthy samples can be distinguished from early GC samples. Three-lncRNA signature in serum was identified as diagnostic marker for GC. This work may facilitate the detection of GC and serve as the basis for further studies of the clinical value of serum lncRNAs in maintaining surveillance and forecasting prognosis. What's new? Certain long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be involved in oncogenesis or tumor suppression, raising questions about their potential service as cancer biomarkers. The authors of the present study systematically assessed the diagnostic value of serum-detectable lncRNAs for gastric cancer (GC) patients. Reverse transcription, quantitative PCR resulted in the identification of a GC-associated three-lncRNA signature centering on CUDR, LSINCT-5 and PTENP1.

The worldwide shortage of pathologists offers a unique opportunity for the use of artificial intelligence assistance systems to alleviate the workload and increase diagnostic accuracy. Here, we report a clinically applicable system developed at the Chinese PLA General Hospital, China, using a deep convolutional neural network trained with 2,123 pixel-level annotated H&E-stained whole slide images. The model achieves a sensitivity near 100% and an average specificity of 80.6% on a real-world test dataset with 3,212 whole slide images digitalized by three scanners. We show that the system could aid pathologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and preventing misdiagnoses. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system performs robustly with 1,582 whole slide images from two other medical centres. Our study suggests the feasibility and benefits of using histopathological artificial intelligence assistance systems in routine practice scenarios.

In addition, circHAS2 has been found to promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells. Therefore, this study explored the potential of circHAS2 as a biomarker for GC. The expression level of circHAS2 in the specimens was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. The molecular characteristics of circHAS2 were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing. The feasibility of the circHAS2 detection method was verified by room temperature placement and repeated freezing and thawing. The diagnostic effect of circHAS2 on GC was evaluated by receiver-operating curve analysis. The correlation between circHAS2 expression level and clinical pathological parameters was analyzed using the & chi;2-test. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was used to analyze the survival situation of the circHAS2 high- and low-expression group. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the influencing factors of prognosis in GC patients. CircHAS2 in cells can be secreted into the blood, and its expression level is significantly upregulated in the serum of patients with GC. The expression level of circHAS2 is correlated with the tissue differentiation, tumor node metastasis staging, classification, and lymph node metastasis of GC patients. CircHAS2 can effectively identify GC and even early GC. In addition, the expression levels of circHAS2 in postoperative GC patients significantly decreased and returned to normal after the second stage of chemotherapy. Finally, the circHAS2 low-expression group had better survival. The upregulated expression of circHAS2 in the serum of GC patients can effectively identify GC and early GC and can be used for effective monitoring of the prognosis of GC patients.

We sought to develop such a test by analysis of DNA methylation from exfoliated cancer cells in feces. We first analyzed methylation of the RASSF2 and SFRP2 gene promoters from 788 primary gastric and colorectal tissue specimens to determine whether methylation patterns could act as stage-dependent biomarkers of gastrointestinal tumorigenesis. Next, we developed a novel strategy that uses single-step modification of DNA with sodium bisulfite and fluorescence polymerase chain reaction methodology to measure aberrant methylation in fecal DNA. Methylation of the RASSF2 and SFRP2 promoters was analyzed in 296 fecal samples obtained from a variety of patients, including 21 with gastric tumors, 152 with colorectal tumors, and 10 with non-neoplastic or inflammatory lesions in the gastrointestinal lumen. Analysis of DNA from tissues showed presence of extensive methylation in both gene promoters exclusively in advanced gastric and colorectal tumors. The assay successfully identified one or more methylated markers in fecal DNA from 57.1% of patients with gastric cancer, 75.0% of patients with colorectal cancer, and 44.4% of patients with advanced colorectal adenomas, but only 10.6% of subjects without neoplastic or active diseases (difference, gastric cancer vs undiseased = 46.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 24.6% to 68.4%, P < .001; difference, colorectal cancer vs undiseased = 64.4%, 95% CI = 53.5% to 75.2%, P < .001; difference, colorectal adenoma vs undiseased = 33.8%, 95% CI = 14.2% to 53.4%, P < .001).

A comprehensive investigation combining multiple detection methods was carried out in the current study to unveil the clinical implications and prospective molecular characterization of FAM189B protein and mRNA in GC. The protein level of FAM189B was clearly upregulated in the tumor tissues of GC as compared to noncancerous gastric tissues with 179 GC cases and 147 noncancerous gastric controls assessed by immunohistochemistry. The upregulation of the FAM189B protein was also found in the more deteriorating period of the tumor, as there were increasing trends in the groups of larger tumors, with lymph node metastasis, a further advanced clinical stage, and a higher histological grade. Next, we focused on the mRNA level of FAM189B in GC tissues using various high-throughput data. After the screening of GEO, ArrayExpress, and SRA, we finally achieved 18 datasets, including an RNA sequencing dataset of TCGA. Altogether, 1095 cases of GC tissue samples were collected, with 305 unique examples of noncancerous controls. Concerning the mRNA level of FAM189B in GC, the final standard mean difference (SMD) was 0.46 and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 for the upregulation of FAM189B mRNA, which confirmed that the FAM189B mRNA level was also markedly upregulated in GC tissues and comparable to its protein level. The survival analysis showed that the higher expression of FAM189B was a risk factor for the overall survival, first progression, and postprogression survival of GC. For the Affymetrix ID 1555515_a_at of FAM189B, the higher expression level of FAM189B predicted a lower overall survival, first progression survival, and postprogression survival with the hazard ratio (HR) being 1.56 (1.24, 1.95), 1.69 (1.32, 2.17), and 1.97 (1.5, 2.6), respectively. For the Affymetrix ID 203550_s_at of FAM189B, a similar result could be found with corresponding HR being 1.49 (1.24, 1.8), 1.49 (1.21, 1.83), and 1.66 (1.32, 2.08), respectively. The interaction of MEM, COXPRESdb coexpressed genes, and DEGs of GC finally generated 368 genes, and the pathway of the cell cycle was the top pathway enriched by KEGG. In conclusion, the overexpression of the FAM189B protein and mRNA might enhance the incidence of GC.",2021/5/26,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:59,,8875971,,8875971,2021,,Biomed Res.

As the causative mutations for these cases are identified this should lead to the development of specific treatments which target the molecular abnormality. The only germline mutations identified so far occur within the E-cadherin gene (CDHI) and they account for approximately 30% of familial gastric cancer cases. When index patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome have a CDHI mutation identified then genetic testing of asymptomatic relatives should be considered. The clinical sequelae of testing positive for such a mutation are profound and therefore it is essential that counselling is given prior to genetic testing. The management options are surveillance endoscopy and prophylactic gastrectomy. In this chapter the practicalities of genetic testing are discussed as well as the pros and cons of the two management options. It is essential that experience of these rare families is pooled so that surveillance and treatment can be optimised in the future.,2006,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:20,,735-743,,4,20,,Best Pract.

Acquired resistance usually limits the duration of response to this treatment, although a number of new agents directed against HER2 have the potential to overcome or prolong the time until resistance occurs. Beyond that, anti-VEGFR2 therapy with ramucirumab was the first biological treatment strategy to produce a survival benefit in an unselected population of patients with chemotherapy-refractory gastroesophageal cancer. Large initiatives are starting to address the role of biomarker-driven targeted therapy in the metastatic and in the perioperative setting for patients with this disease.

The ability of solid malignant tumors to alter the microenvironment represents an important characteristic through which tumor cells are able to acquire specific functions necessary for their malignant biological behaviors. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zincdependent endopeptidases with the capacity of remodeling extracellular matrix (ECM) by degrading almost all ECM proteins, which plays essential roles during the invasion and metastasis process of solid malignant tumors, including allowing tumor cells to modify the ECM components and release cytokines, ultimately facilitating protease-dependent tumor progression. MMP-11, also named stromelysin-3, is a member of the stromelysin subgroup belonging to MMPs superfamily, which has been detected in cancer cells, stromal cells and adjacent microenvironment. Differently, MMP-11 exerts a dual effect on tumors. On the one hand MMP-11 promotes cancer development by inhibiting apoptosis as well as enhancing migration and invasion of cancer cells, on the other hand MMP-11 plays a negative role against cancer development via suppressing metastasis in animal models. Overexpression of MMP-11 was discovered in sera of cancer patients compared with normal control group as well as in multiple tumor tissue specimens, such as gastric cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. At present, some evidence supports that MMP-11 may work as a significant tumor biomarker for early detection of cancer, tumor staging, prognostic analysis, monitoring recurrence during follow-up and also a potential target for immunotherapy against cancer. In view of the importance of MMP-11 in modifying tumor microenvironment and potent antitumoral effects on solid tumors, there is an urgent need for a deeper understanding of how MMP-11 modulates tumor progression, and exploring its potential clinical application.",May-16,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:12,,1783-1793,,5,48,,Int.

Serum samples from patients with gastric cancer and normal healthy control subjects (n = 125) were analysed using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization technology. The spectra were generated on weak cation exchange (WCX2) chips, and protein peak clustering and classification analyses were established using Ciphergen Biomarker Wizard and Biomarker Pattern software, respectively. The diagnostic models were developed and validated by discriminant analysis. In addition, the results of the surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization model were compared with the biomarkers carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 199 in a subset of samples using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay. Five protein peaks at 2046, 3179, 1817, 1725 and 1929 m/z were automatically chosen as components of the best biomarker pattern for diagnosis of gastric cancer. In addition, we identified a single protein peak at 4665 m/z, which could distinguish between stage I/II and stage III/IV gastric cancer with a specificity and sensitivity of 91.6% (11/12) and 95.4% (21/22), respectively. When this biomarker was validated in the second set of samples, the specificity and sensitivity were 91.7% (11/12) and 86.3% (19/22), respectively. The present results suggest that serum surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization protein profiling can distinguish patients with gastric cancer, and in particular stage I/II patients, from normal subjects with a relatively high sensitivity and specificity.

Four human gastric cancer cell lines, 41 primary gastric cancer tissue samples and corresponding peripheral blood samples, and blood samples of 21 healthy individuals were analyzed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the expression of Spartin, the protein product encoded by spastic paraplegia-20, was analyzed in tissues from 119 gastric cancer patients who underwent radical gastrectomy at Xi'an Jiaotong University between 2005 and 2010. Hypermethylation of the spastic paraplegia-20 promoter was observed in 26 of 41 (63.4 %) primary tumors and 1 of 35 (2.9 %) adjacent normal gastric tissues (P < 0.001). Among matched peripheral blood samples from gastric cancer patients, 48.8 % exhibited hypermethylation of the spastic paraplegia-20 promoter. In contrast, no methylation of the spastic paraplegia-20 promoter was observed in blood samples from 21 healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Additionally, demethylation by 5-aza-dC treatment led to gene reactivation in gastric cancer cells exhibiting hypermethylation of the spastic paraplegia-20 promoter. Finally, immunohistochemical staining indicated that low expression of Spartin was a prognostic factor predicting poor outcomes in gastric cancer patients (P = 0.037). These findings suggested that hypermethylation of the spastic paraplegia-20 promoter occurred frequently in gastric cancer and could represent a novel prognostic factor.

Esophageal squamous cell cancer occurs in relation to nutritional deficiency and alcohol or tobacco consumption. Esophageal adenocarcinoma develops in Barrett's esophagus, and stomach cancer in chronic gastric atrophy with Helicobacter pylori infection. Colorectal cancer is favoured by a high intake in calories, excess weight, low physical activity. In opportunistic or individual screening endoscopy is the primary detection procedure offered to an asymptomatic individual. In organized or mass screening proposed by National Health Authorities to a population, endoscopy is performed only in persons found positive to a filter selection test. The indications of primary upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy in opportunistic screening are increasingly developing over the world. Organized screening trials are proposed in some regions of China at high risk for esophageal cancer; the selection test is cytology of a balloon or sponge scrapping; they are proposed in Japan for stomach cancer with photofluorography as a selection test; and in Europe, America and Japan; for colorectal cancer with the fecal occult blood test as a selection test. Organized screening trials in a country require an evaluation: the benefit of the intervention assessed by its impact on incidence and on the 5 year survival for the concerned tumor site; in addition a number of bias interfering with the evaluation have to be controlled. Drawbacks of screening are in the morbidity of the diagnostic and treatment procedures and in overdetection of none clinically relevant lesions. The strategy of endoscopic screening applies to early cancer and to benign adenomatous precursors of adenocarcinoma. Diagnostic endoscopy is conducted in 2 steps: at first detection of an abnormal area through changes in relief, in color or in the course of superficial capillaries; then characterization of the morphology of the lesion according to the Paris classification and prediction of the risk of malignancy and depth of invasion, with the help of chromoscopy, magnification and image processing with neutrophil bactericidal index or FICE. Then treatment decision offers 3 options according to histologic prediction: abstention, endoscopic resection, surgery.

With regard to knowledge, we should be able to identify high-risk background mucosa, and we should be aware of the indicators of a suspicious lesion. Chromoendoscopy and magnifying endoscopy are promising image-enhanced endoscopic techniques for characterization. The proposed criteria for a cancerous lesion are as follows: conventional endoscopic findings of 1) a well-demarcated lesion and 2) irregularity in color/surface pattern; vessel plus surface classification using magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging findings of 1) irregular microvascular pattern with a demarcation line or 2) irregular microsurface pattern with a demarcation line.

In the present study, it was revealed that the expression of COUP-TFII is significantly reduced in gastric carcinoma tissues compared with normal gastric mucosa cells (GES-1). In addition, the expression of COUP-TFII was also reduced in gastric cancer cell lines compared with GES-1 cells. Furthermore, it was revealed that ectopic expression of COUP-TFII was able to suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cells, as well as inhibit hepatic metastasis, in vivo. In addition, it was demonstrated that COUP-TFII knockdown was able to promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of GES-1 cells in vitro.

The ""non-extension sign"" relates to a localized increase in thickness and rigidity due to massive submucosal invasion by a cancer. The present study sought to assess the ability of conventional endoscopy (CE) to correctly identify SM2 cancer using only the non-extension sign. This is a retrospective study based on a prospectively collected database. EGCs had been diagnosed according to invasion depth as M-SM1 or SM2. In terms of the endoscopic diagnostic criterion, lesions positive for the non-extension sign were classified as SM2 cancers, while those negative for the non-extension sign were classified as M-SM1 cancers. Histopathological findings were used as the gold standard. We examined a total of 863 lesions from 704 patients, comprising 104 true-positive, 733 true-negative, 9 false-positive, and 17 false-negative lesions. This yielded a sensitivity of 92.0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 87.0-97.0 %), a specificity of 97.7 % (95 % CI, 96.7-98.8 %), a positive predictive value of 85.9 % (95 % CI, 79.7-92.1 %), a negative predictive value of 98.8 % (95 % CI, 98.0-99.6 %), and a diagnostic accuracy of 96.9 % (95 % CI, 95.8-98.1 %). The non-extension sign may be useful for accurately determining the suitability of minimally invasive endoscopic treatment.

It is unclear whether the ABCD method can predict the risk of gastric neoplasms, including gastric adenomas, as observed for gastric cancer. We aimed to devise a modified ABCD method for predicting gastric neoplasms. We reviewed 562 patients who had undergone upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and whose serum IgG anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody, gastrin, and pepsinogen (PG) I and PG II data were available. Patients were classified into the following four groups: H. pylori antibody negative and normal PG level (group A), H. pylori antibody positive and normal PG level (group B), H. pylori antibody positive and low PG level (group C), and H. pylori antibody negative and low PG level (group D). The PG I/PG II ratio was lower in patients with gastric neoplasms than in patients without these lesions (gastric adenoma vs gastric cancer vs no neoplasm, 3.7 +/- A 2.0 vs 3.8 +/- A 1.8 vs 4.9 +/- A 2.1, P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff values of the PG I/PG II ratio for predicting gastric neoplasms were 3.1 for H. pylori antibody negative patients and 4.1 for H. pylori antibody positive patients. A higher group grade was associated with a significantly higher proportion of gastric neoplasms [odds ratio (95 % confidence interval), group A, reference; group B, 1.783 (1.007-3.156); group C, 3.807 (2.382-6.085); and group D, 5.862 (2.427-14.155)].

Herein we reported to screen out novel volatile biomarkers associated with gastric cancer cells and develop a novel Au-Ag alloy composites-coated MWCNTs as sensing interface for ultrasensitive detection of volatile biomarkers. MGC-803 gastric cancer cells and GES-1 gastric mucous cells were cultured in serum- free media. The sample preparation approaches and HS-SPME conditions were optimized for screening volatile biomarkers. Volatiles emitted from the headspace of the cells/medium culture were identified using GC-MS. The Au-Ag nanoparticles-coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes were prepared as a sensing interface for detection of volatile biomarkers. Results showed that eight different volatile metabolites were screened out between MGC-803 cells and GES-1 cells. Two compounds such as 3-octanone and butanone were specifically present in the headspace of the MGC-803 cells. Three volatiles such as 4-isopropoxybutanol, nonanol and 4-butoxy 1-butanol coexisted in the headspace of both the MGC-803 cells and the GES-1 cells, their concentrations in the headspace of the GES-1cells were markedly higher than those in the MGC-803 cells, three volatiles such as formic acid propyl ester, 1.4-butanediol and 2, 6, 11-trimethyl dodecane solely existed in the headspace of the GES-1 cells. The nanocomposites of MWNTs loaded with Au-Ag nanoparticles were prepared as a electrochemical sensing interface for detection of two volatile biomarkers, cyclic voltammetry studies showed that the fabricated sensor could detect 3-octanone in the range of 0 similar to 0.0025% (v/v) and with a detection limitation of 0.3 ppb, could detect butanone in the range of 0 similar to 0.055% (v/v), and with a detection limitation of 0.5 ppb, and exhibited good selectivity.

In order to detect MMP-9 and IL-6 concentrations with high sensitivity and specificity, an efficient microfluidic-SERS sensing system was prepared based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The aptamer recognition-release mechanism and the dual signal amplification strategy were applied in the sensing system. The sensor system was developed using two kinds of nanomaterials with excellent SERS properties, namely gold-coated iron tetroxide particles (Fe3O4@AuNPs) and gold nanocages (AuNCs). In addition, Fe3O4@AuNPs also has magnetic adsorption properties. In the sensing system, single-stranded DNA1 (ssDNA1) and aptamer were modified on Fe3O4@AuNPs. Single-stranded DNA2 (ssDNA2) and Raman tags were modified on AuNCs. When the target was present, the aptamer bound to the target and detached from the Fe3O4@AuNPs, and ssDNA2 bound to the exposed ssDNA1. At this time, the Fe3O4@AuNPs@AuNCs@SERS tag complex was formed, and the SERS signal was enhanced for the first time. Under the action of an external magnet on the microfluidic chip, the complex was magnetized and enriched. The SERS signal was enhanced for the second time. Due to the high affinity between the aptamer and the target object, the sensing system has a strong specificity. The double amplification of the SERS signal gave the system excellent sensitivity. The limit of detection (LOD) relative to MMP-9 and IL-6 were as low as 0.178 pg/mL and 0.165 pg/mL, respectively.

To achieve this, an electromagnetic actuation system and a wireless MACE with real-time video transmission and orientation feedback are developed. Magnetic actuation modeling and kinematics analysis of the MACE are conducted, based on which an optimization-based position controller and a visual-servo-based orientation controller are designed. Simulative and experimental validation are conducted for proof-of-concept, with attractive results showing that the MACE can be accurately and stably controlled with a mean absolute position error of around 2.56 mm and an average convergent time of about 1.1 s for visual servoing and that automatic stomach screening is successfully demonstrated in a stomach phantom.

More than 80% diagnosis of this cancer occur at later stages leading to low 5-year survival rate. This emphasizes the need to have better prognostic techniques for stomach cancer. In this regard, the Next-Generation Sequencing of whole genome and multi-view approach to omics may reveal the underlying molecular complexity of stomach cancer using high throughput expression data of miRNA. Generally, miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs, which cause downregulation of target mRNAs. They also show differential expression for a specific biological condition like stage or histological type of stomach cancer, highlighting their importance as potential biomarkers. Analyzing miRNA expression data is a challenging task due to the existence of large number of miRNAs and less sample size. A small set of miRNAs will be helpful in designing efficient diagnostic and prognostic tool. In this regard, here a computational framework is proposed that selects different sets of miRNAs for five different categories of clinical outcomes viz. condition, clinical stage, age, histological type, and survival status. First, the miRNAs are ranked using four feature ranking methods. These ranks are used to find an ensemble rank based on adaptive weight. Second, the top 100 miRNAs from each category are used to find the miRNAs that are common to all categories as well as miRNAs that belong to only one category.

Here, we aimed to determine how AI technology is used in gastric cancer diagnosis and analyze how it helps patients and surgeons. Early detection and correct treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) can greatly increase survival rates. To determine this, it is important to accurately determine the diagnosis and depth of the lesion and the presence or absence of metastasis to the lymph nodes, and suggest an appropriate treatment method. The deep learning algorithm, which has learned gastric lesion endoscopyimages, morphological characteristics, and patient clinical information, detects gastric lesions with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and predicts morphological characteristics. Through this, AI assists the judgment of specialists to help select the correct treatment method among endoscopic procedures and radical resections and helps to predict the resection margins of lesions. Additionally, AI technology has increased the diagnostic rate of both relatively inexperienced and skilled endoscopic diagnosticians. However, there were limitations in the data used for learning, such as the amount of quantitatively insufficient data, retrospective study design, single-center design, and cases of non-various lesions. Nevertheless, this assisted endoscopic diagnosis technology that incorporates deep learning technology is sufficiently practical and future-oriented and can play an important role in suggesting accurate treatment plans to surgeons for resection of lesions in the treatment of EGC.",Jul-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:53,,375-387,,3,23,,J.

Several factors influencethe prognosis of STAD, including the expression and regulation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. We here investigated the biomarkers related to the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer, hoping to provide insights for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer in the future. STAD and normal patient RNA sequencing data sets were accessed from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA database). Differential genes were determined and obtained by using the R package DESeq2. The stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE scores are calculated by the ESTIMATE algorithm, followed by the modular genes screening using the R package WGCNA. Subsequently, the intersection between the modular gene and the differential gene was taken and the STRING database was used for PPI network module analysis. The R packages clusterProfiler, enrichplot, and ggplot2 were used for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to screen survival-related genes, and finally, the R package Venn Diagram was used to take the intersection and obtain 7 hub genes. The time-dependent ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier survival curve were used to find the SERPINE1 gene, which plays a critical role in prognosis. Finally, the expression pattern, clinical characteristics, and regulatory mechanism of SERPINE1 were analyzed in STAD. We revealed that the expression of SERPINE1 was significantly increased in the samples from STAD compared with normal samples. Cox regression, time-dependent ROC, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated that SERPINE1 was significantly related to the adverse prognosis of STAD patients. The expression of SERPINE1 increased with the progression of T, N, and M classification of the tumor. In addition, the results of immune infiltration analysis indicated that the immune cells' expression were higher in high SERPINE1 expression group than that in low SERPINE1 expression group, including CD4(+) T cells, B cells, CD8(+) T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and other immune cells. SERPINE1 was closely related to immune cells in the STAD immune microenvironment and had a synergistic effect with the immune checkpoints PD1 and PD-L1.

Overexpression of SIX1 contributes to cancer progression and is associated with adverse outcomes in various cancer types including breast, ovarian, uterine cervical and liver. To investigate the clinicopathological significance of SIX1 protein expression in gastric adenocarcinomas (GAC), localization of the SIX1 protein was determined in MKN-1, a gastric cancer cell line, using immunofluorescence (IF) staining; SIX1 mRNA level was detected in fresh tissues of GAC and normal gastric mucosa using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); and SIX1 protein expression was assessed in 163 GAC, 35 gastric dysplasia and 26 normal gastric mucosa using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Correlations between SIX1 protein expression and pathological parameters of GAC were analyzed using Chi-square tests, differences in survival curves were analyzed using log-rank tests, and multivariate survival analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. SIX1 protein showed a mainly cytoplasmic staining pattern in GAC using IF and IHC staining. The positive SIX1 protein expression rate was 80.4% in GAC, which was significantly higher than in either gastric dysplasia (45.7%) or normal gastric mucosa (26.9%) (P < 0.01). qRT-PCR data also confirmed increased levels of SIX1 mRNA expression in GAC compared with the normal gastric mucosa in fresh tissues. In addition, the strongly positive SIX1 protein expression rate was significantly correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and serosal invasion of GAC (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), while there was no association with gender, age, tumor size, Lauren classification or histological types of GAC Notably, strongly positive signals were frequently observed in tumor blood vessels and/or lymphatic vessels. GAC patients with high expression of the SIX1 had shorter overall and disease-free survival rates than those with low SIX1 protein expression (P < 0.01). Furthermore, using multivariate analysis, SIX1 protein expression was found to be an independent risk factor for survival in patients with GAC along with clinical stage and serosal invasion (P < 0.01). In conclusion, SIX1 protein expression status may be an independent biomarker for prognostic evaluation of GAC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The opportunities presented by these technologies are set out in a clinical context, as are their current limitations. Many of the positive aspects of miniature endoscopy are clear, in that smaller devices provide access to potentially all of the alimentary canal, while conferring high patient acceptability. This must be balanced with the costs of new technologies and recognition of device specific challenges. Perspectives on future application are also considered and the efforts being made to bring new innovations to a clinical platform are outlined.

For some malignancies, screening programs, such as routine colon cancer screenings, have largely aided in the early diagnosis of those at risk. However, even after diagnosis, many GI malignancies lack robust biomarkers to serve as definitive staging and prognostic tools to aid in clinical decision-making. Radiomics uses high-throughput data to extract various features from medical images with the potential to aid personalized precision medicine. Machine learning is a technique for analyzing and predicting by learning from sample data, finding patterns in it, and applying it to new data. We reviewed the fundamental concepts of radiomics such as imaging data acquisition, lesion segmentation, feature design, and interpretation specific to GI cancer studies and assessed the clinical applications of radiomics and machine learning in diagnosis, staging, evaluation of tumor prognosis, and treatment response. Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, consisting of a wide spectrum of pathologies, have become a prominent health issue globally. Despite medical imaging playing a crucial role in the clinical workflow of cancers, standard evaluation of different imaging modalities may provide limited information. Accurate tumor detection, characterization, and monitoring remain a challenge. Progress in quantitative imaging analysis techniques resulted in ""radiomics"", a promising methodical tool that helps to personalize diagnosis and treatment optimization. Radiomics, a sub-field of computer vision analysis, is a bourgeoning area of interest, especially in this era of precision medicine. In the field of oncology, radiomics has been described as a tool to aid in the diagnosis, classification, and categorization of malignancies and to predict outcomes using various endpoints. In addition, machine learning is a technique for analyzing and predicting by learning from sample data, finding patterns in it, and applying it to new data. Machine learning has been increasingly applied in this field, where it is being studied in image diagnosis. This review assesses the current landscape of radiomics and methodological processes in GI cancers (including gastric, colorectal, liver, pancreatic, neuroendocrine, GI stromal, and rectal cancers). We explain in a stepwise fashion the process from data acquisition and curation to segmentation and feature extraction. Furthermore, the applications of radiomics for diagnosis, staging, assessment of tumor prognosis and treatment response according to different GI cancer types are explored. Finally, we discussed the existing challenges and limitations of radiomics in abdominal cancers and investigate future opportunities.",Jan-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:55,,63,,1,15,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 19 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000908663200001,,,,GASTRIC-CANCER; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; machine learning; radiomics; precision oncology; abdominal cancer; COLORECTAL LIVER METASTASES; integrated multi-omics; MICROVASCULAR INVASION; PANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; PREOPERATIVE PREDICTION; RADIOMICS; RECTAL-CANCER; TEXTURE ANALYSIS; 266,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to this, newer and novel endoscopic classifications that were specifically developed for the stomach for assessing and diagnosing gastric lesions have also been included. Illustrative representations of each classification have also been provided to aid readers in better understanding of these endoscopic classifications of early gastric cancer. Endoscopic technologies have been continuously advancing throughout the years to facilitate improvement in the detection and diagnosis of gastric lesions. With the development of different endoscopic diagnostic modalities for EGC, several classifications have been advocated for the evaluation of gastric lesions, aiming for an early detection and diagnosis. Sufficient knowledge on the appearance of EGC on white light endoscopy is fundamental for early detection and management. On the other hand, those superficial EGC with subtle morphological changes that are challenging to be detected with white light endoscopy may now be clearly defined by means of image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE).

Total gastrectomy was performed in 8 symptomatic patients and 22 asymptomatic patients of whom only 3 had HDGC diagnosed preoperatively. 7 of 8 symptomatic had metastatic lymph nodes with cancer. 21 of 22 asymptomatic patients had gastric cancer localized to the stomach and each was cured. 15 of those patients had 9-year follow-up. Each had significant weight loss (23% body weight) with a normal body mass index, 40% had bile reflux controlled with medication, and each returned to work and said they would do it again. Long-term quality of life following gastrectomy was acceptable. Introduction: Gastric cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). The gene associated with HDGC is an E-cadherin gene CDH1. At the time of initiation of this study, it was estimated that 70% of patients who inherited the CDH1 gene mutation would develop gastric cancer. We hypothesized that the rate of signet ring cell cancer in asymptomatic patients with CDH1 mutations may be higher than anticipated and that the surgery could be conducted with acceptable short-term and long-term complications suggesting that the quality of life with the surgery is acceptable. Methods: We prospectively studied the role of total gastrectomy in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with CDH1 mutations. A total of 43 patients with mutations of the CDH1 gene were studied prospectively, including 8 with symptoms and 35 without symptoms. Total gastrectomy was recommended to each. Quality of life was assessed in patients who underwent prophylactic gastrectomy. Proportions are compared with Fisher's exact test. Results: In total, 13 (30%) asymptomatic patients declined surgery. Total gastrectomy was performed in 8 symptomatic patients and 22 asymptomatic patients of whom only 3 asymptomatic patients (14%) had endoscopically proven signet ring cell cancer preoperatively, while 21 of 22 (95%) had it on final pathology (p = 0.05). Each asymptomatic patient was T1, N0, while seven out of eight symptomatic patients had T3-T4 tumors and six had positive lymph nodes. None had operative complications or operative death. The median follow-up was 7 years. Five (63%) symptomatic patients died, while only one (95%) prophylactic patient died of a non-gastric cancer- or surgery-related issue (p = 0.05). A total of 15 prophylactic patients had long-term follow-up. Each had significant weight loss (mean 23%) but all had a normal body mass index. In total, 40% had bile reflux gastritis controlled with sucralfate. Each returned to work and, if given the choice, said that they would undergo the surgery again. Conclusions: Total gastrectomy is indicated for patients who have an inherented CDH1 mutation. Endoscopic screening is not reliable for diagnosing signet ring cell stomach cancer. If patients wait for symptoms, they will have a more advanced disease and significantly reduced survival. Operative complications of prophylactic gastrectomy are minimal, and long-term quality of life is acceptable.",Feb-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,728,,3,14,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 6 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000760515300001,,,,gastric cancer; IMPACT; CDH1; PROPHYLACTIC TOTAL GASTRECTOMY; CDH-1 mutation; GERMLINE MUTATIONS; hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC); PROSPECTIVE-COHORT; 350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This comprehensive review demonstrates how liquid biopsy may be beneficial in identifying and optimizing new diagnostic approaches for gastric cancer. Gastric cancer (GC) is a significant source of global cancer death with a high mortality rate, because the majority of patients with GC are diagnosed at a late stage, with limited therapeutic choices and poor outcomes. Therefore, development of minimally invasive or noninvasive biomarkers which are specific to GC is crucially needed. The latest advancements in the understanding of GC molecular landscapes and molecular biological methods have accelerated attempts to diagnose GC at an early stage. Body fluids, including peripheral blood, saliva, gastric juice/wash, urine, and others, can be a source of biomarkers, offering new methods for the early detection of GC. Liquid biopsy-based methods using circulating sources of cancer nucleic acids could also be considered as alternative strategies. Moreover, investigating gastric juices/washes could represent an alternative for the detection of GC via invasive biopsy. This review summarizes recently reported biomarkers based on DNA methylation, microRNA, long noncoding RNA, circular RNA, or extracellular vesicles (exosomes) for the detection of GC. Although the majority of studies have been conducted to detect these alterations in advanced-stage GC and only a few in population studies or early-stage GC, some biomarkers are potentially valuable for the development of novel approaches for an early noninvasive detection of GC.",Oct-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:01,,2880,,10,12,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 17 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000584238800001,,,,MICRORNAS; PLASMA; DNA METHYLATION; MARKER; CIRCULATING TUMOR-CELLS; POTENTIAL BIOMARKER; liquid biopsy; DNA methylation; circular RNA; microRNA; gastric juice; LONG NONCODING RNAS; extracellular vesicles; MIRNAS; DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS; gastric wash; INSIGHTS; long noncoding RNA; 541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, metabolomics has been used to profile small endogenous metabolites, demonstrating significant potential in the diagnosis/screening of cancer, owing to its ability to conduct a noninvasive sample analysis. Here, we performed a urine metabolomics analysis in the context of an early diagnosis of gastric cancer. This approach showed very high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and performed significantly better than the analysis of serum tumor markers modalities. An additional genomic data analysis revealed the up-regulation of several genes in gastric cancer. This metabolomics-based early diagnosis approach may have the potential for mass screening an average-risk population and may facilitate endoscopic examination through risk stratification. The early detection of gastric cancer (GC) could decrease its incidence and mortality. However, there are currently no accurate noninvasive markers for GC screening. Therefore, we developed a noninvasive diagnostic approach, employing urine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics, to discover putative metabolic markers associated with GC. Changes in urine metabolite levels during oncogenesis were evaluated using samples from 103 patients with GC and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Approximately 70% of the patients with GC (n = 69) had stage I GC, with the majority (n = 56) having intramucosal cancer. A multivariate statistical analysis of the urine NMR data well discriminated between the patient and control groups and revealed nine metabolites, including alanine, citrate, creatine, creatinine, glycerol, hippurate, phenylalanine, taurine, and 3-hydroxybutyrate, that contributed to the difference. A diagnostic performance test with a separate validation set exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of more than 90%, even with the intramucosal cancer samples only. In conclusion, the NMR-based urine metabolomics approach may have potential as a convenient screening method for the early detection of GC and may facilitate consequent endoscopic examination through risk stratification.",Oct-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:01,,2904,,10,12,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 16 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000584040000001,,,,BIOMARKERS; gastric cancer; EXPRESSION; ENDOSCOPY; screening; metabolomics; MANAGEMENT; CA 72-4; CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN; CEA; urine; SPECTROMETRY; EARLY-DIAGNOSIS; CREATININE; 539,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early detection and precise evaluation of GIC are required to further improve treatment outcomes in GIC patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which do not encode proteins, have attracted attention as biomarkers of various diseases. Since the first report revealing the strong correlation between miRNAs and cancer in 2002, numerous studies have illustrated the changes in the expression and the biological and oncological effects of miRNAs in GIC. Furthermore, miRNAs circulating in the blood are reported to be associated with GIC status. These miRNAs are thought to be useful as noninvasive biomarkers because of their stability in blood. Herein, we discuss the potential of miRNAs as noninvasive biomarkers for each type of GIC on the basis of previous reports and describe perspectives for their future application. Gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) is a common disease and is considered to be the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide; thus, new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for GIC are urgently required. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are functional RNAs that are transcribed from the genome but do not encode proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ncRNAs that are reported to function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Moreover, several miRNA-based drugs are currently proceeding to clinical trials for various diseases, including cancer. In recent years, the stability of circulating miRNAs in blood has been demonstrated. This is of interest because these miRNAs could be potential noninvasive biomarkers of cancer. In this review, we focus on circulating miRNAs associated with GIC and discuss their potential as novel biomarkers.",Jul-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:59,,3348,,13,13,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 21 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000670934900001,,,,COLORECTAL-CANCER; GASTRIC-CANCER; gastrointestinal cancer; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; POTENTIAL BIOMARKER; PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA; CELL-FREE MICRORNAS; circulating microRNA; DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS; EXOSOMAL MICRORNA-21; noninvasive tumor markers; NUCLEAR EXPORT; PROGNOSTIC MARKER; 440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, non-invasive diagnostic markers for gastric cancer known to date have poor clinical efficacies. Many studies have shown that gastric cancer patients have distinct microbial changes compared to normal subjects. In the present study, we performed metagenome analysis using body fluid samples (gastric juice, blood, and urine) to investigate the distinct microbial composition using bacteria-derived EVs from gastric cancer patients. We could build diagnostic prediction models for gastric cancer with the metagenomic data and analyzed the accuracy of models. Although further validation is required to apply these findings to real clinical practice yet, our study showed the possibility of gastric cancer diagnosis with the integration of liquid biopsy and metagenome analysis. Early detection is crucial for improving the prognosis of gastric cancer, but there are no non-invasive markers for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer in real clinical settings. Recently, bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerged as new biomarker resources. We aimed to evaluate the microbial composition in gastric cancer using bacteria-derived EVs and to build a diagnostic prediction model for gastric cancer with the metagenome data. Stool, urine, and serum samples were prospectively collected from 453 subjects (gastric cancer, 181; control, 272). EV portions were extracted from the samples for metagenome analysis. Differences in microbial diversity and composition were analyzed with 16S rRNA gene profiling, using the next-generation sequencing method. Biomarkers were selected using logistic regression models based on relative abundances at the genus level. The microbial composition of healthy groups and gastric cancer patient groups was significantly different in all sample types. The compositional differences of various bacteria, based on relative abundances, were identified at the genus level. Among the diagnostic prediction models for gastric cancer, the urine-based model showed the highest performance when compared to that of stool or serum. We suggest that bacteria-derived EVs in urine can be used as novel metagenomic markers for the non-invasive diagnosis of gastric cancer by integrating the liquid biopsy method and metagenome analysis.",Sep-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,4687,,18,13,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 14 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000699575700001,,,,gastric cancer; biomarker; liquid biopsy; extracellular vesicles; 16S rRNA amplicon; HUMAN GUT MICROBIOME; metagenomics; microbiome; 412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there are no available screening programs for GC in United States. Since saliva is a highly desirable body fluid for developing biomarkers of cancer screening, early detection, and monitoring, we previously reported that salivary extracellular RNAs could be developed to detect gastric cancer in a Korean cohort, and here, we validate them in a U.S. cohort. Our study emphasizes the importance of population-specific biomarker development and validation, and specifically, the noninvasive nature of salivary biomarkers for population-based screening in at-risk populations. Gastric cancer (GC) has the fifth highest incidence among cancers and is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death GC has predominantly a higher number of cases in certain ethnic groups such as the Korean population. GC found at an early stage is more treatable and has a higher survival rate as compared with GC found at a late stage. However, a diagnosis of GC is often delayed due to the lack of early symptoms and available screening programs in United States. Extracellular RNA (exRNA) is an emerging paradigm; exRNAs have the potential to serve as biomarkers in panels aimed at early detection of cancer. We previously reported the successful use of a panel of salivary exRNA for detecting GC in a high-prevalence Korean cohort, and that genetic changes reflected cancer-associated salivary exRNA changes. The current study is a case-control study of salivary exRNA biomarkers for detecting GC in an ethnically distinct U.S. cohort. A model constructed for the U.S. cohort combined demographic characteristics and salivary miRNA and mRNA biomarkers for GC and yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.78.

It is preceded by the progressive development of lesions of the gastric mucosa, namely atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia, collectively referred to preneoplasia. Periodic monitoring has been proposed for the surveillance of intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. However, endoscopy, the current gold standard in GC diagnosis, has a limited ability to detect gastric preneoplasia, especially in early stages. In order to overcome the limitations of endoscopy screening, the potential of blood biomarkers has been investigated, and some biomarkers have been identified consistently across different studies. Nevertheless, validation studies in specific populations must be conducted before these results can allow the design of non-invasive tests to be translated into clinical practice for the early detection of patients at risk of developing GC.Abstract Gastric cancer (GC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. It is often associated with a bad prognosis because of its asymptomatic phenotype until advanced stages, highlighting the need for its prevention and early detection. GC development is preceded by the emergence of gastric preneoplasia lesions (GPNLs), namely atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia (DYS). GC is currently diagnosed by endoscopy, which is invasive and costly and has limited effectiveness for the detection of GPNLs. Therefore, the discovery of non-invasive biomarkers in liquid biopsies, such as blood samples, in order to identify the presence of gastric preneoplasia and/or cancer lesions at asymptomatic stages is of paramount interest. This comprehensive review provides an overview of recently identified plasma/serum proteins and their diagnostic performance for the prediction of GPNLs and early cancer lesions. Autoantibodies appear to be promising biomarkers for AG, IM and early gastric cancer detection, along with inflammation and immunity-related proteins and antibodies against H. pylori virulence factors.

The diagnostic efficacy of conventional endoscopy is currently limited. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) can magnify tissue to the cellular level, which is beneficial for endoscopic biopsy. Currently, its clinical application has attracted wide interest among endoscopists. Many studies have explored its application potential in the early diagnosis of digestive tract tumours. This paper reviewed a large number of clinical studies on CLE in early esophageal and gastric cancers, providing more evidence-based support for endoscopists in making clinical decisions. Esophageal and gastric cancers are common diseases with high morbidity and mortality; thus, early detection and treatment are beneficial to improve prognosis. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel imaging technique that permits the histological analysis of tissues during endoscopy. CLE has been shown to uniquely affect the diagnosis of early upper gastrointestinal cancers. Relevant literature was searched using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Despite inherent flaws, CLE can reduce tissue damage and improve diagnostic accuracy to a certain extent. CLE in combination with other imaging methods can help enhance the detection rate and avoid unnecessary biopsies in the management of esophageal or gastric cancer and precancerous lesions.

This review explores the potential of telomeres and telomerase as biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting these cancers. Telomeres are protective caps at chromosome ends that shorten with cell division, while telomerase helps extend them. Changes in these markers could indicate cancer risk and progression. Despite efforts to prevent cancer through lifestyle changes, gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal and gastric cancer remain prevalent. Current detection methods like endoscopy are invasive, driving interest in non-invasive alternatives. By consolidating research on telomere length and telomerase activity, this review aims to highlight how these biomarkers could enhance early diagnosis and monitoring. Understanding these mechanisms better could lead to improved diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies, potentially refining how gastrointestinal cancers are managed and improving patient outcomes.Abstract Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, such as colorectal and gastric cancers, pose significant global health challenges due to their high rates of incidence and mortality. Even with advancements in treatment and early detection, many patients still face poor outcomes, highlighting the critical need for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Telomere length (TL) and telomerase activity (TA) have gained attention in this context. Telomeres, protective nucleotide sequences at chromosome ends, shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular aging. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme, counteracts this shortening by adding telomeric repeats, a process tightly regulated in normal cells but often dysregulated in cancer. This review critically evaluates the role of TL and TA in the pathogenesis of GI cancers, examining their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. It explores how alterations in telomere biology contribute to the initiation and progression of GI tumors and assesses the therapeutic implications of targeting telomerase. By integrating findings from diverse studies, this review aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between telomere dynamics and gastrointestinal carcinogenesis, offering insights into how TL and TA could be leveraged to enhance the early detection, treatment, and prognosis of GI cancers.",Oct-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:50,,3370,,19,16,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 18 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:001331719700001,,,,biomarker; COLORECTAL-CARCINOMA; DOWN-REGULATION; gastrointestinal cancer; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; INCREASED RISK; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PANCREATIC-CANCER; PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS; REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; T-OLIGO; telomerase; telomerase activity; telomere length; telomeres; 33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, about 40% of all gastric cancers have now been resected via endoscopic treatment in Japan. In endoscopic diagnosis, magnifying endoscopic observation using band-limited light such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) has significantly improved the accuracy of gastric cancer diagnosis. At the same time, in endoscopic treatment, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has contributed to notably increasing the number of gastric cancers that can be resected endoscopically. In recent years, the construction of algorithms for endoscopic diagnosis and treatment with a view to personalized medicine has been explored, and the use of endoscopy for gastric cancer management is expected to develop further in the future.Abstract Endoscopy is mandatory to detect early gastric cancer (EGC). When considering the cost-effectiveness of the endoscopic screening of EGC, risk stratification by combining serum pepsinogen values and anti-H. pylori IgG antibody values is very promising. After the detection of suspicious lesions of EGC, a detailed observation using magnifying endoscopy with band-limited light is necessary, which reveals an irregular microsurface and/or an irregular microvascular pattern with demarcation lines in the case of cancerous lesions. Endocytoscopy enables us to make an in vivo histological diagnosis. In terms of the indications for endoscopic resection, the likelihood of lymph node metastasis and technical difficulties in en bloc resection is considered, and they are divided into absolute, expanded, and relative indications. Endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection are the main treatment modalities nowadays. After endoscopic resection, curability is evaluated histologically as endoscopic curability (eCura) A, B, and C (C-1 and C-2). Recent evidence suggests that the outcomes of endoscopic resection for many EGCs are comparable to those of gastrectomy and that endoscopic resection is the gold standard for node-negative early gastric cancers. Personalized medicine is also being developed to overcome the unmet needs in treatments of EGC, for example the further expansion of indications and newer resection techniques, such as full-thickness resection.",Mar-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,1039,,5,16,,Cancers,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 12 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:001182729900001,,,,RISK; early gastric cancer; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI ANTIBODY; SUBMUCOSAL DISSECTION; STOMACH; EMR; endoscopic diagnosis; endoscopic mucosal resection; endoscopic submucosal dissection; gastric cancer screening; MAGNIFYING ENDOSCOPY; MUCOSAL RESECTION; PEPSINOGEN; SERUM-LEVELS; SURGERY; 125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the low sensitivity of serum biomarkers for diagnosis of gastric cancer, especially at its early stage and the poor prognosis of the tumor at the time of diagnosis, its prevention by eradication of H. pylon, remains the mandatory strategy. On the other hand, the severity of regression arid non-reversibility of precancercus lesions and intestinal etaplasia in gastric mucosa through eradication of H. pylori make it necessary to diagnose diffuse gastritis at its early stage. Increased serum pepsinogen II compared to normal serum pepsinogen I seemsto indicate the presence of diffuse gastritis without precancerous lesions suitable for eradication of H. pylon' infection, when it is serologically positive.

The tubular SERS sensor is prepared with a glass capillary loaded with ZIF-67-coated silver particles (Ag@ZIF-67), which offers Raman enhancement from the plasmonic nanoparticles and gas enrichment from the metal-organic framework (MOF) shells. The composite materials are modified with 4-aminothiophenol (4- ATP) to capture different aldehyde and ketone compounds. The tubular sensor is served simultaneously as a gas flow channel and a detection chamber, bringing a higher gas capture efficiency than the planar SERS sensor.

Inflammation impacts multiple serum markers, and relying on a single marker limits diagnostic accuracy. Combining multiple predictive markers improves GC detection. This study aimed to assess the association and combined diagnostic accuracy of a three-dimensional biomarkers panel in GC patients. Eligible patients were recruited into three groups: GC, precancerous conditions/lesions, and controls. The primary outcome was to assess the association and diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional biomarkers in identifying GC and precancerous conditions/lesions. The panel constituted stomach-specific markers (Pepsinogen I, Pepsinogen II, Pepsinogen I & II ratio, Trefoil factor 3, Gastrin 17), GC-related environmental factors (Blood Group Antigen Binding Adhesin A, H. pylori IgG), and cancer-associated biomarkers (Carbohydrate Antigen 19.9, Carbohydrate Antigen 125 and Osteopontin).

This review summarizes the current and future status of linked color imaging (LCI), a new image-enhancing endoscopy (IEE) method, for gastric screening. LCI has been shown to produce bright images even at a distant view and provide excellent visibility of gastric cancer due to high color contrast relative to the surrounding tissue. LCI delineates EGC as orange-red and intestinal metaplasia as purple, regardless of a history of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication, and contributes to the detection of superficial EGC. Moreover, LCI assists in the determination of Hp infection status, which is closely related to the risk of developing gastric cancer. Transnasal endoscopy (ultra-thin) using LCI is also useful for identifying gastric neoplastic lesions. Recently, several prospective studies have demonstrated that LCI has a higher detection ratio for gastric cancer than WLI.

Metabolic profiling may offer the opportunity to understand the molecular mechanism of carcinogenesis and help to non-invasively identify the potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of human gastric cancer. The aims of this study were to explore the underlying metabolic mechanisms of gastric cancer and to identify biomarkers associated with morbidity. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to analyze the serum metabolites of 30 Chinese gastric cancer patients and 30 healthy controls. Diagnostic models for gastric cancer were constructed using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Acquired metabolomic data were analyzed by the nonparametric Wilcoxon test to find serum metabolic biomarkers for gastric cancer. The OPLS-DA model showed adequate discrimination between cancer and non-cancer cohorts while the model failed to discriminate different pathological stages (I-IV) of gastric cancer patients. A total of 44 endogenous metabolites such as amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and steroids were detected, of which 18 differential metabolites were identified with significant differences. A total of 13 variables were obtained for their greatest contribution in the discriminating OPLS-DA model [variable importance in the projection (VIP) value >1.0], among which 11 metabolites were identified using both VIP values (VIP >1) and the Wilcoxon test. These metabolites potentially revealed perturbations of glycolysis and of amino acid, fatty acid, cholesterol, and nucleotide metabolism of gastric cancer patients. These results suggest that gastric cancer serum metabolic profiling has great potential in detecting this disease and helping to understand its metabolic mechanisms.",Jan-12,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:18,,78-85,,1,45,,Brazilian J.

By utilizing publicly available lncRNAs expression profiling data and integrating analyses, we screened out LINC00668, whose expression is significantly increased and correlated with outcomes in gastric cancer (GC). Further experiments revealed that LINC00668 knockdown significantly repressed proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations showed that LINC00668 was a direct transcriptional target of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1). We further demonstrated that LINC00668 was associated with PRC2 and that this association was required for epigenetic repression of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors (CKIs), including p15, p16, p21, p27 and p57, thus contributing to the regulation of the gastric cancer cell cycle.

Early gastric cancer (EGC) is typically characterized by a shallow invasion depth and small size, which can hinder localization of EGC tumors during laparoscopic surgery. Here, we review nine recently reported tumor localization methods for the laparoscopic resection of EGCs. Preoperative dye or blood tattooing has the disadvantage of spreading. Preoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction is not performed in real time during laparoscopic gastrectomy. Thus, they are considered to have a low accuracy. Intraoperative portable abdominal radiography and intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonography methods can provide real-time feedback, but these methods require expertise, and it can be difficult to define the clips in some gastric regions. Despite a few limitations, intraoperative gastrofibroscopy provides real-time feedback with high accuracy. The detection system using an endoscopic magnetic marking clip, fluorescent clip, and radio-frequency identification detection system clip is considered highly accurate and provides real-time feedback; we expect a commercial version of this setup to be available in the near future. However, there is not yet an easy method for accurate real-time detection.

The detection of cancer biomarkers from a small volume of blood is relatively fast compared to the gold standard of tissue biopsies. Traditional immuno-histochemistry (IHC) requires tissue samples obtained using invasive procedures and specific expertise as well as sophisticated instruments. Furthermore, the turnaround for IHC assays is usually several days. To overcome these challenges, on-demand biosensor-based assays were developed to provide more immediate prognostic information for clinicians. Novel rapid, highly precise, and sensitive approaches have been under investigation using physical and biochemical methods to sense biomarkers. Additionally, interest in understanding immune checkpoints has facilitated the rapid detection of cancer prognosis from liquid biopsies. Typically, these devices combine various classes of detectors with digital outputs for the measurement of soluble cancer or immune checkpoint (IC) markers from liquid biopsy samples. These sensor devices have two key advantages: (a) a small volume of blood drawn from the patient is sufficient for analysis, and (b) it could aid physicians in quickly selecting and deciding the appropriate therapy regime for the patients (e.g., immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy). In this review, we will provide updates on potential cancer markers, various biosensors in cancer diagnosis, and the corresponding limits of detection, while focusing on biosensor development for IC marker detection.",Dec-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:57,,500,,12,11,,Biosensors-Basel,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 21 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000736153900001,,,,BIOMARKER; EXPRESSION; GASTRIC-CANCER; BREAST-CANCER; TUMOR-MARKER; PANCREATIC-CANCER; CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN; PD-1; PD-L1; PERIPHERAL-BLOOD; CA 15-3; cancer markers; immune checkpoints; SERUM HER2; 378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the results of these studies have been inconsistent and variable regarding the availability of circulating miRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) diagnosis. Thus, results should be interpreted cautiously. The purpose of the present study was to assess the diagnostic performance of circulating miRNAs in GC diagnosis. We conducted a systematic and comprehensive approach for the inclusion of studies. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio were pooled with random effects models, and a summary of receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curves were plotted. The potential heterogeneity was assessed with Q test and I-2 statistics. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions further investigated the sources of heterogeneity. A total of 77 studies from 48 articles were eligible for the meta-analysis. The results revealed a sensitivity of 0.76, a specificity of 0.81, and an AUC of 0.86 for gastric cancer diagnosis with circulating miRNAs. In addition, subgroup analyses indicated that multiple miRNAs assays, non-microarray screening approaches, and serum-based miRNA assays exhibited good diagnostic performance in contrast to a single miRNA assay, microarray expression profiling screening, and plasma-based miRNA group analysis. The diagnostic ability of miRNAs in early stage I-II groups and the high expression group were approximately similar to that in the stage I-IV groups and the low expression group. For the circulating miRNAs, our meta-analysis identified a combination of multiple miRNAs, non-microarray chip screening, and serum-based miRNA assays were associated with the most effective GC diagnostic performance. However, many unclear molecular mechanisms limited the accuracy of the diagnostic results, and should be interpreted with caution. Further large-scale prospective studies are required for validating the diagnostic applicability of circulating miRNAs in gastric cancer patients.",Jan-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,87-102,,1,41,,Oncol.

The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to test the sensitivity and specificity of GC diagnosis using these identified plasma microRNAs. Three plasma microRNAs, miR-106b, miR-20a, and miR-221, were significantly elevated in GC patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the areas under the ROC curves using miR-106b, miR-20a, and miR-221 for GC diagnosis were 0.7733 (95 % CI, 0.7758-0.8409), 0.8593 (95 % CI, 0.8046-0.9139), and 0.7960 (95 % CI, 0.7256-0.8664), respectively.

Based on training cohort (n=7299), we developed the m6A-miRNAs signature using a support vector machine algorithm for cancer detection. The m6A-miRNAs signature showed high accuracy, and its area under the curve (AUC) in the training, internal validation and external validation cohort reached 0.979 (95%CI 0.976 - 0.982), 0.976 (95%CI 0.973 - 0.979) and 0.936 (95%CI 0.922 - 0.951), respectively.

The current study presents the first reported population-based data from a large GC screening program that provided endoscopic examinations. A retrospective population-based study was conducted using the National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP) database. We evaluated GC detection rates, sensitivity, specificity, and the positive predictive value of an endoscopic screening program for the average-risk Korean population, aged 40 years and older, who underwent the NCSP from 2002 to 2005. The detection rates of GC by endoscopy in the first and subsequent rounds were 2.71 and 2.14 per 1000 examinations, respectively. Localized cancer accounted for 45.7% of screen-detected GC cases. The sensitivity of endoscopy was 69% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66.3-71.8). The endoscopic screening was less sensitive for the detection of localized GC (65.7%, 95% CI = 61.8-69.5) than for regional or distant GC (73.6%, 95% CI = 67.4-79.8). In the multiple logistic models for localized GC and all combined GC, the odds ratio (OR) of sensitivity for the undifferentiated type was statistically significantly higher than that for the differentiated type, whereas the OR of sensitivity for the mixed type was lower than that for the differentiated type. The sensitivity of the endoscopic test in a population-based screening was slightly higher for the detection of regional or distant GC than for localized GC. Further evaluation of the impact of endoscopic screening should take into account the balance of cost and mortality reduction.

Methods: A series of experiments in vitro and in vivo were conducted to reveal the role of PLAGL2 in GC progression. Results: The data revealed that PLAGL2 promotes GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated the critical role of PLAGL2 in the stabilization of snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (Snail1) and promoting Snail1-mediated proliferation and migration of GC cells. PLAGL2 activated the transcription of deubiquitinase USP37, which then interacted with and deubiquitinated Snail1 protein directly. In addition, GSK-3 beta-dependent phosphorylation of Snail1 protein is essential for USP37-mediated Snail1 deubiquitination regulation.

Distinguishing individuals with precancerous gastric lesions that have progression potential to GC is an important need. Perturbated lipid metabolism, particularly the dysregulation of de novo lipogenesis, is involved in gastric carcinogenesis. We conducted the first prospective lipidomics study exploring lipidomic signatures for the risk of gastric lesion progression and early GC. Methods: Our two-stage study of targeted lipidomics enrolled 400 subjects from the National Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Early Detection Program in China, including 200 subjects of GC and different gastric lesions in the discovery and validation stages. Of validation stage, 152 cases with gastric lesions were prospectively followed for the progression of gastric lesions for a median follow-up of 580 days (interquartile range 390-806 days). We examined the lipidomic signatures associated with the risk of advanced gastric lesions and their progression to GC. Our published tissue proteomic data were referred to further investigate highlighted lipids with their biologically related protein expression in gastric mucosa. Results: We identified 11 plasma lipids significantly inversely associated with the risk of gastric lesion progression and GC occurrence. These lipids were integrated as latent profiles to identify 5 clusters of lipid expression that had distinct risk of gastric lesion progression. The latent profiles significantly improved the ability to predict the progression potential of gastric lesions (AUC: 0.82 vs 0.68, Delong's P = 4.6x10(-4)) and risk of early GC (AUC: 0.81 vs 0.55, P = 6.3x10(-5)). Significant associations were found between highlighted lipids, their biologically correlated proteins and the risk of GC, supporting the role of the pathways involving monocarboxylic acid metabolism and lipid transport and catabolic process in GC. Conclusions: Our study revealed the lipidomic signatures associated with the risk of gastric lesion progression and GC occurrence, exhibiting translational implications for GC prevention.",2022,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,4671-4683,,10,12,,Theranostics,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 13 Place: Lake Haven Publisher: Ivyspring Int Publ Web of Science ID: WOS:000809420200002,,,,Biomarker; Gastric cancer; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION; CLASSIFICATION; HIGH-RISK; POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS; FERROPTOSIS; Lipidomics; PHOSPHOLIPIDS; Precancerous gastric lesion; 365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, 60 paired tumor and normal DNA samples from GEJA patients were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing. Among them, 13 were Siewert type I, 14 were type II, and 33 were type III. A predominance of C/G>T/A substitutions was discovered in GEJA, followed by C/G>A/T substitutions. Notably, Siewert type I and type II/III display distinct sets of driver genes, mutational spectrum, and recurrently disrupted pathways. Siewert type I showed similarity to esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) and the chromosomal instability subtype of stomach adenocarcinomas, while Siewert type II/III showed similarity to the genomic stable subtype of stomach adenocarcinoma. We also found that mutation ofFBXW7, a driver gene of GEJA, was enriched in Siewert type I.

Current methodological approaches for miRNAs analysis are not satisfactory and suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor sensitivity and laborious handling procedures. In this study, an integrated protocol based on magnetic beads (MBs) and chemiluminescence (CL) technique was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of miRNAs from gastric cancer plasma. Factors that may influence the chemiluminescent signal were also systematically investigated and optimized.

Findings This cohort study of 21 535 222 participants from the Korean National Cancer Screening Program database found that the monthly number of endoscopic examinations increased toward the end of the year. However, the gastric cancer detection rates were negatively and significantly associated with calendar month. Meaning The findings of this cohort study suggest the importance of the implementation of policy guidelines to strengthen the merits of the screening program, including a reduction in gastric cancer-related mortality. Importance The rapidly increasing number of gastric cancer examinations performed over a short period might influence screening performance. Accessing the association between calendar month and gastric cancer detection rates might improve policy and guide institutional support. Objective To evaluate the association between the increased number of examinations over a certain period and gastric cancer detection rates among a large population included in the Korean National Cancer Screening Program (KNCSP). Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective, population-based cohort study used data from the KNCSP comprising 26 765 665 men and women aged 40 years or older who participated in the screening program between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. Exposures Gastric cancer screening with endoscopy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was monthly gastric cancer detection rates in the KNCSP. A negative binomial regression model was used to evaluate the association between the screening month and detection rates. Results In total, 21 535 222 individuals underwent endoscopy (mean [SD] age, 55.61 [10.61] years; 11 761 709 women [54.62%]). The quarterly number of participants was the highest in the last quarter of the study period (2013-2014: 4 094 951 [41.39%], 2015-2016: 4 911 629 [42.19%]); this proportion was 2.48 to 2.84 times greater than that of the first quarter. Cancer detection rates were the lowest in December (2013-2014: 0.22; 95% CI, 0.22-0.23; 2015-2016: 0.21; 95% CI, 0.21-0.22); this was approximately a 40.0% to 45.0% reduction compared with the rates in January. The age group was the significant factor for monthly detection rates. After adjustment for the age group and taking account of the number of screenings, the estimated coefficient range for the screening month was negative and the detection rate in December was significantly different than in January for both the consequent cycles (2013-2014: -0.05 to -0.18; P < .001; and 2015-2016: -0.06 to -0.19; P < .001). In the multivariable logistic model, the association of calendar month with detected cancer remained after adjusting for other confounding factors (December, 2013-2014: odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.87; P < .001; 2015-2016: odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study suggest that the workload of endoscopists increased with the increasing number of examinations toward the end of the year, as demonstrated by the decreased cancer detection rates. These findings may help to improve gastric cancer detection rates of screening programs by controlling the monthly screening number and policy modifications. This cohort study compares the numbers of endoscopic examinations for gastric cancer screening over quarters of a calendar year with rates of gastric cancer diagnosed during those periods.",2021/1/7,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:00,,e2032542,,1,4,,JAMA Netw.

It is urgent and necessary to find suitable prognostic markers. miR-619-5p is highly expressed in GC. However, the value of miR-619-5p and its target genes as prognostic biomarkers of GC is unclear.MethodsRT-PCR was performed to verify the expression of miR-619-5p in GC cell lines and their exosomes. Western blotting and transmission electron microscope were used to identify exosomes. The target genes of miR-619-5p were predicted by RNA22 and TargetScan. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and prognosis-related genes (PRGs) were obtained using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The DAVID database was used to analyse pathway enrichment and functional annotation of common target genes. The STRING database and Cytoscape software were used to screen key genes and visualize their functional modules. The survival analysis was conducted using TCGA and Kaplan-Meier Plotter (KMP) databases. Finally, a prognostic model was constructed on the foundation of the key genes to assess the reliability of the screening process.ResultsThe expression of miR-619-5p in GC cells and their exosomes was proved to be significantly higher than that in normal cell lines. There are 129 common target genes involved in 3 pathways and 28 functional annotations. Finally, nine key target genes of GC (BRCA1, RAD51, KIF11, ERCC6L, BRIP1, TIMELESS, CDC25A, CLSPN and NCAPG2) were identified, and a prognostic model was successfully constructed with a good predictive ability.ConclusionsThe model of 9-gene signature could effectively predict the prognosis of GC, and have great potential to be novel prognostic factors and therapeutic targets for patients with GC.",Nov-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,3296-3306,,11,25,,Clin.

Materials and Methods: Blood ADAM 8 was measured by ELISA. Cytokines/chemokines [intedeukin-23 (IL-23), stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha/CXC chemokine ligand 12 (SDP-1 alpha/CXCL12), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L)] were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay. 'they were compared among five groups; normal/gastritis, high-risk, early GC (EGC), advanced GC (AGC) without distant metastasis, and AGC with distant metastasis by one-way analysis of variance in both training (n=80) and validation dataset (n=241). Clinicopathological features of GC and GC-associated cytokines were evaluated for their correlations with blood ADAM 8. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy to predict GC, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression were used. Results: Blood ADAM 8 significantly increased along GC carcinogenesis in both training (ANOVA, p<0.001) and validation dataset (p<0.001). It was significantly higher in EGC compared to high-risk (post-hoc Bonferroni, p=0.041) and normal (p<0.001). It was also higher in AGC compared with high-risk (p<0.001) and normal (p<0.001) groups. However, no significant difference was found between cancer groups. Blood ADAM 8 was correlated with N-stage (Spearman's correlation, gamma(s) =0.320, p=0.011), but not with T-stage or M-stage. Pearson's correlations showed blood ADAM 8 was closely correlated with pre-inflammatory cytokines, IL-23 (p=0.036) and SDF-1 alpha/CXCL12 (p=0.037); however, it was not correlated with pro-angiogenic cytokine IL-8 (p=0.313), and sCD4OL (p=0.702). ROC curve and logistic regression demonstrated that blood ADAM 8 showed higher diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, 73.7%; specificity, 86.2%) than CEA (sensitivity, 23.1%; specificity, 91.4%). Combination of ADAM 8 and CEA further increased the diagnostic accuracy to predict GC (sensitivity, 81.8%; specificity, 84.0%).

Methods: We estimated the mean serum levels of CEA, PGs, and hsCRP and compared the sensitivity and specificity of these 3 biomarkers in 378 subjects who were classified into 7 groups: normal, chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, adenoma, early gastric cancer (EGC), advanced gastric cancer (AGC) without metastasis, and AGC with metastasis (M-1). Results: There were no significant differences among the normal, high-risk (chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and adenoma), and EGC groups for CEA and hsCRP. However, the levels of CEA were relatively higher in the AGC group with intestinal-type cancer (P < 0.01). Likewise, hsCRP was relatively higher in the AGC group with diffuse-type cancer (P < 0.01). For the PG I II ratio, there was no significant difference among the normal, high-risk, and cancer groups, including EGC (P < 0.01). In addition, there was a negative correlation with grades (gamma(s) = -0.480, P < 0.01). However, the PG I/II ratio was relatively less effective in diffuse-type cancere compared with intestinal-type cancer. The combination of serum hsCRP and the PG I/II ratio had a higher sensitivity (77%) than did the PG I/II ratio alone (61%) in diffuse-type cancers. Conclusions: The combination of serum hsCRP adn PG I/II ratio would be helpful as a screening tool for gastric cancer in high incidence populations and may help to select high-risk subjects in need of further specific invasive screening tools such as endoscopy.",Jan-09,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:19,,19-26,,1,43,,J.

Methods: Four independent gastric cancer databases (GSE27342, GSE29272, GSE54129 and TCGA-STAD) were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was used to identify the abnormally active pathways in patients with gastric cancer. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify genes with stable prognostic value in gastric cancer patients based on three independent gastric cancer databases (GSE15459, GSE62254, TCGA-STAD). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the possible pathways related to FKBP10. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to determine the expression of FKBP10 mRNA in the HGC-27 and MKN-7 cell lines. Adhesion assay was used to detect changes in cell adhesion ability. FKBP10, ITGA1, ITGA2, ITGA5, ITGAV, ITGA6, P-AKT473, P-AKT308, AKT, and beta -actin were evaluated by Western blot (WB). Results: We first performed differential expression genes (DEGs) screening of four independent GC databases (GSE27342, GSE29272, GSE54129 and TCGA-STAD). Eighty-nine genes showed consistent up-regulation in GC, the results of pathway analysis showed that they were related to ""Focal adhesion"". The prognostic value of these 89 genes was tested in three independent GC databases GSE15459, GSE62254 and TCGA-STAD cohort. Finally, 12 genes, in which the expression of FKBP10 was prominently increased in patients with lymph node metastasis (LNM), showed stable prognostic value. The following gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) also showed that FKBP10 is mainly involved in cell adhesion process, while adhesion experiments confirmed that cell adhesion was down-regulated after silencing FKBP10 in GC cells, and adhesion-related molecules integrin aVand a6 were down-regulated.

Methods: We firstly identified 5 kinds of candidate genes related to gastric cancer, including differential pathway genes (DPGs) based on the attract method, hub genes in differential pathways based on mutual information network (MIN) analysis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by Significance Analysis of.Microarrays (SAM), informative genes (DEGs in differential pathways), and key genes (hub DEGs). Then, the classification efficiency of these 5 kinds of candidate genes were assessed using support vector machines (SVM) model. The genes with the best classification efficiency were considered as salivary biomarkers in gastric cancer. Results: Using the attract method, we screened 5 differential pathways in gastric cancer, in which there were 349 DPGs. Based on these DPGs, MIN with 345 genes and 1313 interactions was constructed, from which we obtained 26 hub genes by topological analysis. Meanwhile, we identified 374 DEGs in gastric cancer. Combining DEGs with DPGs and hub genes respectively, we selected 16 informative genes and 5 key genes. SVM analysis showed that the key genes presented the best classification efficiency with AUC=0.99, specificity=1.00, sensitivity=0.98 and MCC=0.95, which would be considered as salivary biomarkers in gastric cancer.

The secondary purpose was to identify factors influencing willingness to undergo gastroscopy.Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in selected cities and counties from nine provinces in China using a multi-stage sampling approach. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the independent predictors of willingness to undergo gastroscopy.Results: This study included 1900 participants, and 1462 (76.95%) responded that they would undergo gastroscopy for GC screening. Participants of younger age, from the eastern region, living in an urban area, with higher educational levels, with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, or with precancerous stomach lesions, were more willing to undergo gastroscopy. The top four reasons to reject gastroscopy were fear of pain or discomfort, worry about a possible devastating test result, no symptoms in self-feeling, and concern about the high expense. Of all those who would reject gastroscopy for GC screening, 36.76% (161/438) would be willing to accept painless gastroscopy, while 24.89% (109/438) would be willing to undergo gastroscopy screening if higher medical reimbursement rates were available. Participants considered that gastroscopy was a relatively fearful and unknown procedure, accompanied by high risks and benefits compared to all other life events.Conclusion: In general, 76.95% of participants over 40 years old were willing to undergo gastroscopy for GC screening in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants' willingness to undergo GC screening increased due to medical resource constraints and increased interest in their health.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of endoscopic screening interval on the stage, cancer-related mortality, and treatment methods of UD-type gastric cancer. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the medical records of newly diagnosed patients with UD gastric cancer in 2013, in whom the interval between previous endoscopy and diagnosis could be determined. The patients were classified into different groups according to the period from the previous endoscopy to diagnosis (<12 months, 12-23 months, 24-35 months, >= 36 months, and no history of endoscopy), and the outcomes were compared between the groups. In addition, patients who underwent endoscopic and surgical treatment were reclassified based on the final treatment results. Results: The number of enrolled patients was 440, with males representing 64.1% of the study population; 11.8% of the participants reported that they had undergone endoscopy for the first time in their cancer diagnosis.

However, the influence of the color enhancement settings for the laser endoscopic system on the visibility of lesions with higher color contrast than their surrounding mucosa has not been established. Materials and Methods: Forty early gastric cancers were retrospectively evaluated using color enhancement settings C1 and C2 for laser endoscopic systems with blue laser imaging (BLI), BLI-bright, and linked color imaging (LCI). The visibilities of the malignant lesions in the stomach with the Cl and C2 color enhancements were scored by expert and non-expert endoscopists and compared, and the color differences between the malignant lesions and the surrounding mucosa were assessed. Results: Early gastric cancers mainly appeared orange-red on LCI and brown on BLI-bright or BLI. The surrounding mucosae were purple on LCI regardless of the color enhancement but brown or pale green with CI enhancement and dark green with C2 enhancement on BLI-bright or BLI. The mean visibility scores for BLI-bright, BLI, and LCI with C2 enhancement were significantly higher than those with Cl enhancement. The superiority of the C2 enhancement was not demonstrated in the assessments by non-experts, but it was significant for experts using all modes. The C2 color enhancement produced a significantly greater color difference between the malignant lesions and the surrounding mucosa, especially with the use of BLI-bright (P=0.033) and BLI (P<0.001).

We evaluated whether an artificial intelligence-based gastric lesion detection and diagnostic system, ENdoscopy as AI-powered Device Computer Aided Diagnosis for Gastroscopy (ENAD CAD-G), could reduce this discrepancy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively collected 24,948 endoscopic images of early gastric cancers (EGCs), dysplasia, and benign lesions from 9,892 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy between 2011 and 2021. The diagnostic performance of ENAD CAD-G was evaluated using the following real-world datasets: patients referred from community clinics with initial biopsy results of atypia (n=154), participants who underwent endoscopic resection for neoplasms (Internal video set, n=140), and participants who underwent endoscopy for screening or suspicion of gastric neoplasm referred from community clinics (External video set, n=296). Results: ENAD CAD-G classified the referred gastric lesions of atypia into EGC (accuracy, 82.47%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 76.46%-88.47%), dysplasia (88.31%; 83.24%-93.39%), and benign lesions (83.12%; 77.20%-89.03%). In the Internal video set, ENAD CAD-G identified dysplasia and EGC with diagnostic accuracies of 88.57% (95% CI, 83.30%-93.84%) and 91.43% (86.79%-96.07%), respectively, compared with an accuracy of 60.71% (52.62%-68.80%) for the initial biopsy results (P<0.001). In the External video set, ENAD CAD-G classified EGC, dysplasia, and benign lesions with diagnostic accuracies of 87.50% (83.73%-91.27%), 90.54% (87.21%-93.87%), and 88.85% (85.27%-92.44%), respectively. Conclusions: ENAD CAD-G is superior to initial biopsy for the detection and diagnosis of gastric lesions that require endoscopic resection.

We evaluated the quality indicators of the revised NEQIP and outcome measures of endoscopy at different types of healthcare facilities participating in the NCSP. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted between March and August 2018 in primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities that perform endoscopy as a part of the NCSP. Representative endoscopists completed a questionnaire for quality indicators of the NEQIP and provided data on outcome measures for endoscopy. Results: Quality indicators of the NEQIP were mostly acceptable. However, the quality indicators for annual volume of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, training for endoscopy quality improvement by endoscopy nursing staff, colonoscopy reports, documentation of pathologic lesions, quality of endoscopy reprocessing areas, and completion of endoscopy reprocessing education programs were suboptimal. For outcome measures of EGD, the number of photo-documentations and total procedure time were higher at tertiary healthcare facilities than at other facilities (p<0.001 and p=0.023, respectively). For the outcome measures of colonoscopy, colonoscopy completion rate and waiting times for colonoscopy were significantly higher at tertiary healthcare facilities than at other facilities (both p<0.001).

We aimed to compare the diagnostic performance and visibility scores of HD and SD ultraslim endoscopes in EGC. Materials and Methods: We used HD and SD ultraslim endoscopes to obtain 60 images with similar compositions of gastric environments. Of the 60 images, 30 showed EGC (15 images for each modality) and 30 showed no EGC (15 images for each modality). Seventeen endoscopists evaluated the presence and location of the lesions in each image. Diagnostic ability was compared between modalities. The color difference between a lesion and the surrounding mucosa (Delta E) was measured and compared between the modalities. Results: The ability of HD to detect EGC was significantly higher than that of SD (accuracy: 80.8% vs. 71.6%, P=0.017; sensitivity: 94.9% vs. 76.5%, P<0.001; positive predictive value, 76.2% vs. 55.3%, P<0.001; and negative predictive value (NPV), 94.1% vs. 73.5%, P<0.001). The ability of HD to determine the horizontal extent of EGC was significantly higher than that of SD (accuracy: 71.0% vs. 57.8%, P=0.004; sensitivity: 75.3% vs. 49.0%, P<0.001; NPV, 72.9% vs. 55.9%, P<0.001; and area under the curve: 0.891 vs. 0.631, P=0.038).

Comparative analysis of cell surface protein landscape will provide an experimental basis for biomarker discovery, which is essential for targeted molecular therapies. This study aimed to isolate phage-displayed antibody fragments recognizing cell surface proteins, which were differently expressed between two closely related GC cell lines, namely AGS and MKN-45. Methods: We selected and screened a semisynthetic phage-scFv library on AGS, MKN-45, and NIH-3T3 cell lines by utilizing a tailored selection scheme that was designed to isolate phagescFvs that not only recognize the differentiated AGS cells but also distinguish them from NIH3T3 fibroblasts and the poorly differentiated MKN-45 cells. Results: After four rounds of subtractive whole cell panning, 14 unique clones were identified by ELISA screening and nucleotide sequencing. For further characterization, we focused on four phage-scFvs with strong signals in screening, and their specificity was confirmed by cell-based ELISA. Furthermore, the selected phage-scFvs were able to specifically stain AGS cells with 38.74% (H1), 11.04% (D11), 76.93% (G11), and 69.03% (D1) in flow cytometry analysis which supported the ability of these phage scFvs in distinguishing AGS from MKN-45 and NIH-3T3 cells. Conclusion: Combined with other proteomic techniques, these phage-scFvs can be applied to membrane proteome analysis and, subsequently, identification of novel tumor-related antigens mediating proliferation and differentiation of cells. Furthermore, such antibody fragments can be exploited for diagnostic purposes as well as targeted drug delivery of GC. © 2019 The Author (s).",2019,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:18,,,,4,9,,Adv. Pharm.

However, most cases are diagnosed at advanced stage because of the lack of screening programs. Therefore, the identification of plasma biomarkers for early detection is necessary. Experimental Design: To search for these biomarkers, we evaluated the DNA methylation patterns of 24 genes by Methylation-specific PCR in primary tissues from 32 retrospectively collected gastric cancer cases (testing group). Correlation between methylation and gene expression was evaluated in the MKN-45 cell line after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The most frequently hypermethylated genes were next evaluated in primary tissues and plasma samples from 43 prospectively collected gastric cancer cases as well as plasma samples from 31 asymptomatic age- and gender-matched controls (validation group). Results: In the testing group, 11 genes were hypermethylated in at least 50% of cases (APC, SHP1, E-cadherin, ER, Reprimo, SEMA3B, 3OST2, p14, p15, DAPK, and p16). Eight genes (BRCA1, p73, RAR beta, hMLH1, RIZI, RUNX3, MGMT, and TIMP3) were statistically associated with a particular variant of gastric cancer, the signet-ring cell type (P = 0.03). Seven genes (APC, SHP1, E-cadherin, ER, Reprimo, SEMA3B, and 3OST2) were next evaluated in the validation group. We confirm the high frequency of methylation in primary tumors for all seven genes. However, only APC and Reprimo were frequently methylated in pair plasma samples. In asymptomatic controls, only Reprimo was infrequently methylated in comparison with plasma from gastric cancer cases (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our results identified specific methylation profile associated to signet-ring cell-type histology and aberrant hypermethylation of Reprimo as a potential biomarker for early detection of gastric cancer.",2008/10/1,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:19,,6264-6269,,19,14,,Clin.

It is urgent to identify non-invasive biomarkers for GC. The objective of our study was to find out non-invasive biomarkers for early detection and surveillance of GC based on glycomic analysis. Method: Ethyl esterification derivatization combined with MALDI-TOF MS analysis was employed for the comprehensive serum glycomic analysis in order to investigate glycan markers that would indicate the onset and progression of gastric cancer. Upon the discovery of the candidate biomarkers, those with great potential were further validated in an independent test set. Peaks were acquired by the software of MALDI-MS sample acquisition and processing and analyzed by the software of Progenesis MALDI. Results: The differences in glycosylation were found between non-cancer controls and gastric cancer samples: hybrid and multi-branched type (tri-, tetra-antennnary glycans) N-glycans were increased in GC, yet monoantennary, galactose, bisecting type and core fucose N-glycans were decreased. In training set, core fucose (AUC=0.923, 95% CI: 0.8485 to 0.9967) played an excellent diagnostic performance for the early detection of gastric cancer. The diagnostic potential of core fucose was further validated in an independent cohort (AUC=0.854, 95% CI: 0.7592 to 0.9483). Besides, several individual glycan structures reached both statistical criteria (p-values less than 0.05 and AUC scores that were at least moderately accurate) when comparing different stages of GC samples. Conclusion: We comprehensively evaluate the serum glycan changes in different stages of GC patients including peritoneal metastasis for the first time. We determined several N-glycan biomarkers, some of these have potential in distinguishing the early stage GC from healthy controls, and the others can help to monitor the progression of GC.

This investigation looks at the diagnostic potential of a specific plasma exosomal miRNAs panel for GC. Methods: This study analyzed 216 individual peripheral blood samples. 2 GEO datasets were analyzed and two miRNAs were selected - plasma exosomal miR-195-5p and miR-211-5p. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess relative expressions and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic efficiency of miR-195-5p and miR-211-5p panel. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the prognostic value of plasma exosomal miR-195-5p and miR-211-5p. Results: GC patients possessed notably raised plasma levels of exosomal miR-195-5p and miR-211-5p. The area under ROC curves (AUCs) of miR-195-5p, miR-211-5p were 0.745, 0.798 in the screening phase and 0.762, 0.798 in the training stage respectively.

Poorer prognosis was observed in GC patients who had plasma exosomal miR-195-5p and miR-211-5p of higher levels. In vitro experiments also confirmed that miR-195-5p and miR-211-5p is able to be transmitted between cells, and works to enhance tumor invasion, migration and proliferation while inhibiting cell apoptosis.

Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) are a new class of non-coding RNAs which is closely related to GC. Nevertheless, the clinical application value of circRNAs in GC are largely unknown. Therefore, we studied the role of a novel circRNA named circCSPP1 in patients with GC. Methods: CircRNA sequencing was performed to screen out the target molecule. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect the expression level of circCSPP1 in GC tissues, cells, and serum. Gel and Sanger sequencing were utilized to verify the ring structure of circCSPP1. RNase R enzyme digestion experiment and actinomycin D experiment were verifed the advantage of circCSPP1 as a diagnostic biomarker in patients with GC when that compared with linear RNA. The correlation between the expression level of serum circCSPP1 and clinicopathological data of GC patients was further analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under ROC curve (AUC) were utilied to evaluate the diagnostic performance. Results: CircCSPP1 has a circular structure which with resistance to RNA exonuclease digestion and long half-life compared with linear RNA. In our study, circCSPP1 was first found up-regulated in patients with GC. Serum circCSPP1 level was decreased significantly after surgical resection whereas increased after recurrence. High expression of circCSPP1 was associated with poor survival rates. The expression level of circCSPP1 was significantly correlated to tumor size, T stage, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. The AUC of serum circCSPP1 was 0.834, with high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating patients with GC from healthy donors. More importantly, the combined diagnosis of circCSPP1, CEA, and CA19-9 achieved the superior AUC of 0.882, with the highest specificity.

Accurate and affordable noninvasive detection methods have potential value for screening and surveillance. Herein, we identify novel methylated DNA markers (MDM) for gastric adenocarcinoma, validate their discrimination for gastric adenocarcinoma in tissues from geographically separate cohorts, explore marker acquisition through the oncogenic cascade, and describe distributions of candidate MDMs in plasma from gastric adenocarcinoma cases and normal controls. Experimental Design: Following discovery by unbiased whole-methylome sequencing, candidate MDMs were validated by blinded methylation-specific PCR in archival case-control tissues from U.S. and South Korean patients. Top MDMs were then assayed by an analytically sensitive method (quantitative real-time allele-specific target and signal amplification) in a blinded pilot study on archival plasma from gastric adenocarcinoma cases and normal controls. Results: Whole-methylome discovery yielded novel and highly discriminant candidate MDMs. In tissue, a panel of candidate MDMs detected gastric adenocarcinoma in 92% to 100% of U.S. and South Korean cohorts at 100% specificity. Levels of most MDMs increased progressively from normal mucosa through metaplasia, adenoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma with variation in points of greatest marker acquisition. In plasma, a 3-marker panel (ELMO1, ZNF569, C13orf18) detected 86% (95% CI, 71-95) of gastric adenocarcinomas at 95% specificity. Conclusions: Novel MDMs appear to accurately discriminate gastric adenocarcinoma from normal controls in both tissue and plasma. The point of aberrant methylation during oncogenesis varies by MDM, which may have relevance to marker selection in clinical applications. Further exploration of these MDMs for gastric adenocarcinoma screening and surveillance is warranted. (C) 2018 AACR.",2018/11/15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,5724-5734,,22,24,,Clin.

However, much effort to date has focused on single cancers. In this context, gastrointestinal (GI) cancers constitute the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide; yet there is no blood-based assay for the early detection and population screening of GI cancers. Experimental design: Herein, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of multiple GI cancers to develop a pan-GI diagnostic assay. By analyzing DNA methylation data from 1,781 tumor and adjacent normal tissues, we first identified differentially methylated regions (DMR) between individual GI cancers and adjacent normal, as well as across GI cancers. We next prioritized a list of 67,832 tissue DMRs by incorporating all significant DMRs across various GI cancers to design a custom, targeted bisulfite sequencing platform. We subsequently validated these tissue-specific DMRs in 300 cfDNA specimens and applied machine learning algorithms to develop three distinct categories of DMR panels Results: We identified three distinct DMR panels: (i) cancer-specific biomarker panels with AUC values of 0.98 (colorectal cancer), 0.98 (hepatocellular carcinoma), 0.94 (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma), 0.90 (gastric cancer), 0.90 (esophageal adenocarcinoma), and 0.85 (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma); (ii) a pan-GI panel that detected all GI cancers with an AUC of 0.88; and (iii) a multi-cancer (tissue of origin) prediction panel, EpiPanGI Dx, with a prediction accuracy of 0.85-0.95 for most GI cancers. Conclusions: Using a novel biomarker discovery approach, we provide the first evidence for a cfDNA methylation assay that offers robust diagnostic accuracy for GI cancers.",Nov-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:57,,6135-6144,,22,27,,Clin.

In this study, ten serum markers were assessed using the Luminex system and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the diagnosis of gastric cancer and analysis of the relation between prognosis and metastases. Patients and methods: A training set consisting of 228 gastric adenocarcinoma and 190 control samples was examined. A Luminex multiplex panel with nine biomarkers, consisting of three proteins discovered through our previous studies and six proteins previously reported to be cancer-associated, was constructed. One additional biomarker was detected using a commercial kit containing EDTA. Logistic regression, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to identify the panel of discriminatory biomarkers in the training set. After selecting five proteins as candidate biomarkers, multivariate classification analyses were used to identify algorithms for diagnostic biomarker combinations. These algorithms were independently validated using a set of 57 gastric adenocarcinoma and 48 control samples. Results: Serum pepsinogen I, serum pepsinogen II, A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 8 (ADAM8), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and serum IgG to Helicobacter pylori were selected as classifiers in the three algorithms. These algorithms differentiated between the majority of gastric adenocarcinoma and control serum samples in the training/test set with high accuracy (RF 79.0%, SVM 83.8%, logistic regression 76.2%). These algorithms also differentiated the samples in the validation set (accuracy: RF 82.5%, SVM 86.1%, logistic regression 78.7%). Conclusion: A panel of combinatorial biomarkers comprising VEGF, ADAM8, IgG to H. pylori, serum pepsinogen I, and pepsinogen II were developed. The use of biomarkers is a less invasive method for the diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma.

Experimental design In biomarker discovery, a total of 12 patient gastric fluid samples (stages I, III, IV and gastritis) were analysed by 2DE for expression changes that correlated with GC status or disease progression. Gastric fluid proteins showing differential expression with GC were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS as putative biomarkers. Levels of these potential biomarker candidates were independently validated by Western blotting in further 60 gastritis and GC patients. A targeted approach that recruits biomarker candidates for panel consideration was adopted to test if two or more biomarkers in combination improved diagnostic power. Results From the 15 differentially regulated proteins identified, expression levels of S100A9, GIF and AAT in the gastric fluid clearly correlated with GC status. S100A9/AAT (AUC = 0.81) and S100A9/GIF (AUC = 0.92) were revealed as promising biomarker pairs for early GC diagnosis and disease monitoring, respectively. Conclusion and clinical relevance Early diagnosis, accurate staging and constant disease monitoring remain the prerequisites for effective treatment against GC. As current biomarkers like CA199 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) lack sensitivity and specificity, there is a pressing need for novel GC detection and monitoring methods. To this end, S100A9, GIF and AAT from the gastric fluid may significantly augment existing methods of GC detection and monitoring, and eliminate the need for invasive tissue biopsies.",Apr-12,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:18,,152-162,,3月4日,6,,Proteom.

Materials and Methods A total 10,909 and 4,773 subjects from the KMCC with information on gastroendoscopy (GE) and upper gastrointestinal series (UGIS) were included in this study. Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, Helicobacter pylori infection, cigarette smoking, and alcohol drinking was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results The GE screened subjects had almost half the risk of GC-specific death than that of unscreened subjects (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.94). Among the GC patients, GE screenees had a 2.24-fold higher survival rate than that of the non-screenees (95% CI, 1.61 to 3.11). In particular, GE screenees who underwent two or more screening episodes had a higher survival rate than that of the non-screenees (HR, 13.11; 95% CI, 7.38 to 23.30). The effectiveness of GE screening on reduced GC mortality and increased survival rate of GC patients was better in elderly subjects (>= 65 years old) (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.95 and HR, 8.84; 95% CI, 3.63 to 21.57, respectively) than that in younger subjects (< 65 years old) (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.29 and HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.68, respectively).

Methods In this prospective study, patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) from three hospitals between August 2016 to November 2020 were enrolled. The Exo HER2 level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was drawn referring to the HER2 tissue status to assess the diagnostic value of Exo HER2. Cox proportional hazards regression and logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between Exo HER2 and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR) in patients who received trastuzumab-based first-line therapy. Results In this study, 242 patients with advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma were registered. Of these, 238 AGC patients were eligible for evaluating serum-derived exosome HER2 diagnostic value, including 114 HER2-positive. Finally, 64 were eligible for efficacy analysis. The area under the ROC curve was 0.746. The optimal cutoff value for diagnosing tissue HER2-positive status was 729.95 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of 74.2%.

Identifying proteins secreted from tumor cells could lead to the discovery of clinically useful biomarkers for early detection of gastric cancer. Experimental design A SILAC-based quantitative proteomic approach was employed to identify secreted proteins that were differentially expressed between neoplastic and non-neoplastic gastric epithelial cells. Proteins from the secretome were subjected to SDS-PAGE and SCX-based fractionation, followed by mass spectrometric analysis on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. Immunohistochemical labeling was employed to validate a subset of candidates using tissue microarrays. Results We identified 2205 proteins in the gastric cancer secretome of which 263 proteins were overexpressed greater than fourfold in gastric cancer-derived cell lines as compared to non-neoplastic gastric epithelial cells. Three candidate proteins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), lectin mannose binding 2 (LMAN2), and PDGFA-associated protein 1 (PDAP1) were validated by immunohistochemical labeling. Conclusions and clinical relevance We report here the largest cancer secretome described to date.

Specifically, microRNAs (miRs) hold promise as prognostic biomarkers because dysregulation of individual miRs is implicated in tumorigenesis, progression, and metastases of various malignancies, including gastric adenocarcinoma (GC). STUDY DESIGN: To identify miRs prognostic of survival after radical gastrectomy, we studied GC patients within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) who had undergone R0 or R1 resection and had data on clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS), and tumor miR expression. The miRs expressed by at least 15% of tumors were eligible for study. From 10 replicate samples, each with 80% of patients, miRs were selected using age-adjusted proportional hazards regression with stepwise selection. Cross-validated miRs (selected by multiple replicates) were retained if they optimized an accelerated failure-time model of OS using all patients. RESULTS: In this GC cohort (n 1/4 270), half (916/1,870) of miRs screened met our criteria for evaluation. Cross-validation identified 20 miRs as prognostic, of which 14 (miR-129-1, miR-373, miR-490, miR-597, miR-1185-2, miR-3943, miR-4756, miR-5683, miR-6510, miR-6733, miR-6808, miR-6855, miR-6882, miR-8072) were independently informative. The age-adjusted 14-miRNA panel remained significantly associated with OS after adjustment for pathologic prognostic factors (number of lymph nodes examined, number of positive lymph nodes) and other clinical covariates (TNM stage, residual tumor, tumor microsatellite instability, targeted molecular therapy, sex, race, ethnicity). Panel-predicted survival estimates below the upper tertile cut-off were associated with worse outcome (30% vs 74% OS at 3 years, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In surgically resected GC patients, an epigenetic signature of miRs associated with survival has the potential to improve prognostication.

The result showed that the expression of circulating miR-222 in plasma was significantly upregulated in GC compared with CAG and healthy controls (all at P < 0.001). And its high level was significantly correlated with clinical stages (P < 0.001) and lymph nodes metastasis (P = 0.009). The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses revealed that miR-222 had considerable diagnostic accuracy, yielded an AUC (the areas under the ROC curve) of 0.850 with 66.1 % sensitivity and 88.3 % specificity in discriminating GC from healthy controls.

However, due to intrusive inspections and limited sensitivity, the prevailing diagnostic methods impede precisely large-scale screening. In this work, we reported a high-throughput serum metabolic patterns (SMP) screening strategy based on covalent organic frameworks-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (hf-COFsLDI-MS) for early diagnosis and staging of CRC and GC. Notably, 473 high-quality SMP were extracted without any tedious sample pretreatment and coupled with multiple machine learning algorithms; the area under the curve (AUC) value is 0.938 with 96.9% sensitivity for early CRC diagnosis, and the AUC value is 0.974 with 100% sensitivity for early GC diagnosis. Besides, the discrimination of CRC and GC is accomplished with an AUC value of 0.966 for the validation set. Also, the screened-out features were identified by MS/MS experiments, and 8 metabolites were identified as the biomarkers for CRC and GC.

However, traditional PLSS uses either a rotatable polarizer or two orthogonal polarizers to purify the single scattering light, which makes it complicated and challenged to build a PLSS endoscope. Herein, we propose a snapshot PLSS with a single optical path to directly get the single scattering light for the first time. The single scattering light is encoded using the spectrally-modulated polarimetry and decoded using the continuous slide iterative method. Both the polystyrene microsphere solutions and the ex vivo gastric cancer samples are used to verify the method. The experimental results of the snapshot PLSS are consistent well with that of the traditional PLSS.

Aim. Amino acid metabolism in cancer patients differs from that in healthy people. In the study, we performed urine-free amino acid profile of gastric cancer at different stages and health subjects to explore potential biomarkers for diagnosing or screening gastric cancer. Methods. Forty three urine samples were collected from inpatients and healthy adults who were divided into 4 groups. Healthy adults were in group A (n = 15), early gastric cancer inpatients in group B (n = 7), and advanced gastric cancer inpatients in group C (n = 16); in addition, two healthy adults and three advanced gastric cancer inpatients were in group D (n = 5) to test models. We performed urine amino acids profile of each group by applying ion chromatography (IC) technique and analyzed urine amino acids according to chromatogram of amino acids standard solution. The data we obtained were processed with statistical analysis. A diagnostic model was constructed to discriminate gastric cancer from healthy individuals and another diagnostic model for clinical staging by principal component analysis. Differentiation performance was validated by the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results. The urine-free amino acid profile of gastric cancer patients changed to a certain degree compared with that of healthy adults. Compared with healthy adult group, the levels of valine, isoleucine, and leucine increased (P < 0.05), but the levels of histidine and methionine decreased (P < 0.05), and aspartate decreased significantly (P < 0.01). The urine amino acid profile was also different between early and advanced gastric cancer groups. Compared with early gastric cancer, the levels of isoleucine and valine decreased in advanced gastric cancer (P < 0.05). A diagnosis model constructed for gastric cancer with AUC value of 0.936 tested by group D showed that 4 samples could coincide with it. Another diagnosis model for clinical staging with an AUC value of 0.902 tested by 3 advanced gastric cancer inpatients of group D showed that all could coincide with the model. Conclusions. The noticeable differences of urine-free amino acid profiles between gastric cancer patients and healthy adults indicate that such amino acids as valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, histidine and aspartate are important metabolites in cell multiplication and gene expression during tumor growth and metastatic process. The study suggests that urine-free amino acid profiling is of potential value for screening or diagnosing gastric cancer.",2012,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:18,,474907,,474907,2012,,Gastroenterol.

However, the current methods for detecting PG I and PG II can barely satisfy the needs of mass screening, especially in remote areas. In this study, a rapid and sensitive fluorescent immunochromatographic test strip with a miniature analytical device (20.0 cm x 18.9 cm x 11.2 cm, 2.4 kg) was developed for the simultaneous determination of PG I and PG II in one sample in a single assay, which is promisingly suitable for the mass screening of gastric cancer. Under the optimum conditions, PG I and PG II concentrations as low as 2.6 ng/mL and 1.0 ng/mL could be detected in 15 min with only 7.5 mu L plasma specimen, and no cross-reactivity was observed. The detection range was linear over 10.0-210.0 ng/mL for PG I and 3.0-63.0 ng/mL for PG II. The immunosensor also demonstrated high recoveries (93.6-110.8% for PG I and 95.4-110.4% for PG II) with low coefficient of variation (CV) (4.8-8.1% for PG I and 6.6-11.7% for PG II) when testing actual human plasma. The analyses by the proposed assay correlated well with those by ELISA of 30 spiked samples. The assay was finally applied to 30 clinical samples, and the results showed its clinical significance for the early screening of gastric cancer. Therefore, the assay proposed in this study provides a rapid, sensitive, and simultaneous detection strategy in the pepsinogen test, and the results indicated its potential capacity in the mass screening of gastric cancer.",2019/5/1,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:05,,272-281,,,286,,Sens.

The main way to improve the prognosis of GC is to predict the tumorigenesis and metastasis in the early stage. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the ability of human plasma amino acid metabolic profile for discriminating GC and GU. In this study, we first used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique to characterize the plasma amino acid metabolism in GC and GU patients. Plasma samples were collected from 84 GC patients and 82 GU patients, and 22 amino acids were detected in each patient. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis model was performed to analyze the data of these amino acids. We observed seven differential amino acids between GC and GU. A regression analysis model was established using these seven amino acids. Finally, a panel of five differential amino acids, including glutamine, ornithine, histidine, arginine and tryptophan, was identified for discriminating GC and GU with good specificity and sensitivity. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate diagnostic ability of the regression model and area under the curve was 0.922. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the potential values of plasma amino acid metabolic profile and metabolomic analysis technique in assisting diagnosis of GC. More studies are needed to highlight the theoretical strengths of metabolomics to understand the potential metabolic mechanisms in GC.

Therefore, it is necessary to identify an effective screening method to detect precursor lesions of GC (PLGC) and EGC to increase the 5-year survival rate of patients. Cell-free RNA, as a biomarker, has shown potential in early diagnosis, personalised treatment, and prognosis of cancer. In this study, six RNAs (CEBPA-AS1, INHBA-AS1, AK001058, UCA1, PPBP, and RGS18) were analysed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the plasma of patients with EGC and PLGC to identify diagnostic biomarkers. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. Among the six RNAs, four lncRNAs (CEBPA-AS1, INHBA-AS1, AK001058, and UCA1) were upregulated and two mRNAs (PPBP and RGS18) were downregulated in the plasma of patients with PLGC and EGC. According to the findings of the ROC analysis, the four-RNA combination of INHBA-AS1, AK001058, UCA1, and RGS18 had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value for determining risk of GC in patients with PLGC and the six-RNA combination including CEBPA-AS1, INHBA-AS1, AK001058, UCA1, PPBP, and RGS18 had the highest AUC value for determining the risk of GC in patients with EGC.

TCGA database reported that about half of gastric cancers exhibit abnormalities in cell-cycle-related molecules, suggesting that gastric cancer is a good candidate for palbociclib treatment; however, the antitumor effects and predictive markers of palbociclib in gastric cancer remain incompletely described. Herein, the effect and predictive markers of palbociclib on gastric cancer cells were investigated. Our results reveal that palbociclib showed anti-proliferative effects by inducing G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence in some gastric cancer cells. Basal protein expression level of cyclin E showed an inverse correlation of cancer cell sensitivity to palbociclib. In addition, palbociclib enhanced the antitumor effect of 5-FU in vitro and in vivo by modulating thymidine synthase expression. These results suggest that cyclin E protein expression determines the anti proliferative effect of palbociclib, and palbociclib acts synergistically with 5-FU in gastric cancer. These findings provide a rationale for future clinical trials of palbociclib and 5-FU combination-based chemotherapy in gastric cancer.

In previous research, PAK1 has been involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, such as cell motility, cell proliferation, gene transcription, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell invasion. Hyper-activation of PAK1 was constantly observed in a variety of human cancer which make it a potential target of novel anti-tumor drugs. To date, a great number of attentions focus on identifying the PAK1 inhibitors in medical and pharmaceutical fields. In this article, we found that a novel and potent PAK1 inhibitor, AK963/40708899, suppressed the proliferation of human gastric cancer cells significantly by downregulation of PAK1-NF-kappa B-cyclinB1 pathway. In addition, AK963/40708899 inhibited the formation of filopodia and promoted cell adhesion which in turn inhibited invasive potential of gastric cells by negatively regulating PAK1-LIMKl-cofilin and PAK1-ERK-FAK pathways.

Urine is a favored biofluid for biomarker discovery due to its noninvasiveness to patients. Accurate quantification of these oxidative nucleic acid modifications still has challenges because their amounts in urine are very low and the interferences in urine samples are complicated. Herein, we developed and validated an accurate and robust solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of these oxidative nucleic acid modifications in human urine. Stable isotope dilution strategy was utilized and the method shows good precision on intraday and interday measurements. Meanwhile, recovery was satisfactory by utilizing the Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridge for sample pretreatment at three spiked levels. We successfully quantified urinary 8-OHdG and 8-OHG from 60 gastric cancer patients and 70 healthy controls by using this method. The measured contents of 8-OHdG and 8-OHG in urine from gastric cancer patients are both increased, compared with those in urine from healthy controls, indicating these oxidative nucleic acid modifications could act as potential non-invasive markers for early diagnosis of gastric cancer.

However, there was a lack of imaging agents exhibiting molecular specificity for EGCs. Here, we employed the dye labeled human heavy-chain ferritin (HFn) as imaging nanoprobe, which recognizes tumor biomarker transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), to enable specific EGC imaging using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE). TfR1 expression was initially examined in vitro in gastric tumor cells and in vivo through whole-body fluorescence and CLE imaging in tumor-bearing mice. Subsequently, dye labeled HFn was topically applied to resected human tissues for EGC detection. CLE analysis of TfR1-targeted fluorescence imaging allowed distinction of neoplastic from non-neoplastic tissues (P < 0.0001), and TfR1 expression level was found to correlate with EGC differentiation degrees (P < 0.0001). Notably, the CLE evaluation correlated well with the immunohistochemical findings (kappa-coefficient: 0.8023). Our HFn-nanoprobe-based CLE increases the accuracy of EGC detection and enables visualization of tumor margins and endoscopic resection. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Most GI neoplasms arise from precancerous lesions; thus, technical innovations to improve detection and diagnosis of precancerous lesions and early cancers play a pivotal role in improving outcomes. Over the last few decades, the field of GI endoscopy has witnessed enormous and focused efforts to develop and translate accurate, user-friendly, and minimally invasive optical imaging modalities. From a technical point of view, a wide range of novel optical techniques is now available to probe different aspects of light-tissue interaction at macroscopic and microscopic scales, complementing white light endoscopy. Most of these new modalities have been successfully validated and translated to routine clinical practice. Herein, we provide a technical review of the current status of existing and promising new optical endoscopic imaging technologies for GI cancer screening and surveillance. We summarize the underlying principles of light-tissue interaction, the imaging performance at different scales, and highlight what is known about clinical applicability and effectiveness. Furthermore, we discuss recent discovery and translation of novel molecular probes that have shown promise to augment endoscopists' ability to diagnose GI lesions with high specificity. We also review and discuss the role and potential clinical integration of artificial intelligence-based algorithms to provide decision support in real time.

MethodsThis study enrolled 13,440 participants with confirmed Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection status who underwent screening endoscopy by 20 endoscopists in our health screening center. The participants were divided into two groups: one group was observed using white light imaging (WLI) only by 17 endoscopists (WLI group, 10,745 participants), and the other group was observed using TXI2 only by the other three endoscopists (TXI2 group, 2695 participants). We analyzed the detection rate and the characteristics of GC. In addition, considering the bias due to the diagnostic ability, we analyzed the subset of the WLI group where the participants were evaluated by the top three endoscopists based on their GC detection rate (Expert-WLI group, 2792 participants) for comparison with the TXI2 group. ResultsFifty patients were diagnosed with GC. The GC detection rates were 0.68% and 0.71% in the Expert-WLI and TXI2 groups, respectively.

In 2008, we started RCP for early detection of new gastric cancer after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). In gastric cancer treatment, RCP after surgical resection had been widely used, but little is known about RCP after ESD. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of RCP after ESD.MethodsThis study included 465 patients on whom our RCP was implemented from 2008 to 2018. A regional family physician performed surveillance endoscopy at 3 months and 1 year after ESD and annually thereafter. We retrospectively evaluated the cumulative incidence and treatment outcomes of new gastric cancer and compared them with previous reports.ResultsDuring a median follow-up period of 70.5 months (3-120 months), 58 patients developed new gastric cancers, and metachronous gastric cancer was detected in 55 patients more than 1 year after ESD. The 5-year cumulative incidence rate was 9.8%. Three patients did not want treatment. Among the remaining 55 patients, the initial treatment was ESD in 51 and surgical resection in 4.

We also examined the clinical trial design features that may mitigate the risk of clinical trial failure. Materials and Methods:Clinical trial data was obtained from clinicaltrials.gov. Drugs were included if they entered testing between January 1, 1998 and January 1, 2022 and were excluded if they did not have a completed phase I trial or treated secondary effects of gastric cancer. Transition probabilities were calculated for each phase and compared with industry averages. Success rates were determined based on biomarker usage, drug target, type of therapy, and drug chemistry. Results:Upon screening 1990 trials, 219 drugs met our inclusion criteria. The probability of a drug completing all phases of testing and obtaining FDA approval was 7%, which is below the 11% industry average. The use of biomarkers in clinical development resulted in nearly a 2-fold increase in the cumulative success rate. Biologics also exhibited higher success rates (17%) as opposed to small molecules (1%). This was true even when we compared both drug types that shared the same target. When comparing only receptor-targeted therapies, biologics (62%) continued to outperform small molecules (18%). Similarly, when narrowed down to drugs targeting solely HER2 receptors, biologics continued to prevail (64% vs. 24%).

Simpler screening tests such as capsule endoscopy could be helpful, but gastric visualization is insufficient with the current passive capsules. A magnetically guided gastric capsule was prospectively evaluated in patients with routine indications for gastroscopy. Methods: A total of 189 symptomatic patients (105 male; mean age 53 y) from 2 French centers subsequently and blindly underwent capsule and conventional gastroscopy by 9 and 6 examiners, respectively. The final gold standard was unblinded conventional gastroscopy with biopsy under propofol sedation. Main outcome was accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) of capsule gastroscopy for diagnosis of major gastric lesions, defined as those lesions requiring conventional gastroscopy for biopsy or removal. Results: Twenty-three major lesions were found in 21 patients. Capsule accuracy was 90.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 85.4%-94.3%] with a specificity of 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3%-97.1%) and a sensitivity of 61.9% (95% CI, 38%-82%). Accuracy did not correlate with lesion location, gastric luminal visibility, examiner case volume, or examination time. Of the remaining 168 patients, 94% had minor and mostly multiple lesions; the capsule made a correct diagnosis in 88.1% (95% CI, 82.2%-92.6%), with gastric visibility and lesion location in the proximal stomach having significant influence. All patients preferred capsule gastroscopy. Conclusions: In a prospective and strictly blinded study, magnetically guided capsule gastroscopy was shown to be feasible in clinical practice and was clearly preferred by patients.

Methods: A Markov cohort model has been developed in Microsoft Excel 2016 for the population identified to be at intermediate risk (Singaporean men, aged 50-75 years with Chinese ethnicity). The interventions compared were (1) initial screening using miRNA test followed by endoscopy for test-positive individuals and a 3-yearly follow-up screening for test negative individuals (proposed strategy), and (2) no screening with gastric cancer being diagnosed clinically (current practice). The model was evaluated for 25 years with a healthcare perspective and accounted for test characteristics, compliance, disease progression, cancer recurrence, costs, utilities, and mortality. The outcomes measured included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cancer stage at diagnosis, and thresholds for significant variables. Results: The miRNA-based screening was found to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40 971/ quality-adjusted life-year. Key drivers included test costs, test accuracy, cancer incidence, and recurrence risk. Threshold analysis highlights the need for high accuracy of miRNA tests (threshold sensitivity: 68%; threshold specificity: 77%). A perfect compliance to screening would double the cancer diagnosis in early stages compared to the current practice.

This study aimed to identify factors contributing to the population effectiveness of cancer screening, estimate the number needed to screen (NNS) to reduce one gastric cancer-related death, and evaluate the expected mortality-rate reduction in endoscopic screening for gastric cancer in 184 countries.Methods: Factors contributing to the attributable risk, NNS, and mortality-rate reduction were identified. A rapid review was performed in PubMed to estimate the pooled relative risk of endoscopic screening compared to that of no screening for mortality reduction. NNSs and mortality-rate reduction were estimated using the pooled relative risk and GLOBOCAN data.Results: The crude mortality rate, the effectiveness of the screening modality, and the screened rate contributed to the attributable risk, NNS, and mortality-rate reduction in cancer screening. The pooled relative risk was 0.58 in endoscopy screening compared to that in no screening. NNSs and expected mortality-rate reduction differed across countries and ranged from 2522 to 91,575 and 0.2 to 7.9 (per 100,000 individuals) for the screened rate of 20%, respectively.Conclusions: In addition to the effectiveness of the used modality, the disease burden and screened rate were important in the population effectiveness of cancer screening. Regarding the high NNSs and the low expected mortality-rate reduction, population-based endoscopic screening seems not to be effective in many countries, and these results are meaningful in decision-making regarding the introduction of endoscopic screening.",Apr-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,e296,,1,4,,DEN Open,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:001144973500001,,,,gastric cancer; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI; endoscopy; early detection of cancer; early diagnosis; HOMOLOGOUS-RECOMBINATION GENES; stomach neoplasms; 114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective screening might allow for earlier detection and curative resection. Among a USA-based multiracial and ethnic cohort diagnosed with non-cardia gastric cancer (NCGC), we aimed to identify factors associated with curable stage disease at diagnosis.; METHODS: We retrospectively identified endoscopically diagnosed and histologically confirmed cases of NCGC at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic and histologic factors, as well as grade/stage of NCGC at diagnosis were documented. The primary outcome was the frequency of curable-stage NCGC (stage 0-1a) at diagnosis in patients with versus without an endoscopy negative for malignancy prior to their index exam diagnosing NCGC. Additional factors associated with curable-stage disease at diagnosis were determined.; RESULTS: A total of 103 racially and ethnically diverse patients were included. Nearly 38% of NCGC were stage 0-Ia, 34% stage Ib-III, and 20.3% stage IV at diagnosis. A significantly higher frequency of NCGC was diagnosed in curable stages among patients who had undergone an endoscopy that was negative for malignancy prior to their index endoscopy that diagnosed NCGC, compared to patients without a negative endoscopy prior to their index exam (69.6% vs. 28.6%, p=0.003). A prior negative endoscopy was associated with 94.0% higher likelihood of diagnosing curable-stage NCGC (p=0.003). No other factors analyzed were associated with curable-stage NCGC at diagnosis.; CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic screening and surveillance in select high-risk populations might increase diagnoses of curable-stage NCGC.

This study aimed to determine whether risk stratification is possible using the data obtained from medical examination or endoscopic findings. METHODS: First, subjects who underwent both cancer screening and medical examination from 2009 to 2015 and underwent cancer screening once more by 2016 were studied. Data such as the lipid profile and history of smoking obtained during the medical examination, and the grade of atrophy and presence of peptic ulcers were studied using multivariate analysis. Next, subjects who underwent cancer screening twice or more between 2009 and 2015 with or without medical examinations were studied to analyze any correlation between the grade of atrophy and cancer occurrence using univariate analysis. In both studies, the status of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection was determined. RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, 9378 subjects were included. Aging, advanced atrophy, presence of ulcers, and uric acid levels were identified as risk factors. Among subjects who underwent successful HP eradication therapy, advanced atrophy and aging were observed to be crucial risk factors. In the univariate analysis, there were 12,941 subjects. Gastric cancer occurred more frequently in the more severe atrophy group (P < 0.001). The annual rate of cancer occurrence in the most severe atrophy group was 0.31%, which was approximately thrice as that in the less atrophy group.

Furthermore, there are no well-established guidelines concerning screening and surveillance even for higher risk patients such as those with nondysplastic noncardia gastrointestinal metaplasia (GIM), and thus they are not routinely performed. This study was designed to provide new evidence-based data that can be used to support the implementation of biennial surveillance guidelines in individuals with nondysplastic noncardia GIM. This practice can help detect early malignant lesions, thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of surveillance endoscopies for noncardia gastric cancer in populations with two different pathological diagnoses: mixed GIM and incomplete GIM (iGIM).Methods: Markov state transition models were developed using a cohort simulation of 1000 hypothetical patients. Analysis was conducted for both mixed and iGIM. Quality-adjusted life-years and transition probabilities were derived from the published medical literature. Costs associated with endoscopy, cancer care, and surgery were based on Medicare reimbursement. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year was used to determine cost-effectiveness.Results: Our study determined that it is significantly cost-effective to perform biennial endoscopy surveillance in patients who have been incidentally found to have noncardia mixed GIM, with a cost savings of $5783.84 per person, and in those with iGIM, with a cost savings of $8093.08 per person.Conclusions: Biennial endoscopy surveillance should be considered in all individuals found to have mixed or incomplete noncardia GIM on endoscopy. Furthermore, screening specifically for iGIM after differentiating between the two groups can lead to further cost savings. As such, we recommend that pathologists routinely differentiate between the two and recommend robust routine surveillance of iGIM.",Dec-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,951-956,,12,116,,South.Med.J.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 6 Place: Philadelphia Publisher: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Web of Science ID: WOS:001106460500004,,,,HELICOBACTER-PYLORI INFECTION; RISK-FACTORS; ADENOCARCINOMA; ASSOCIATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INTESTINAL METAPLASIA; ERADICATION; COHORT; CARE; gastrointestinal metaplasia; GIM; Markov cohort simulation; NCGA; noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma; 158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optical enhancement mode 2 is a new image-enhanced endoscopic technique that offers bright images and can improve the visibility of neoplastic lesions. This study aimed to compare the detection of neoplastic lesions with optical enhancement mode 2 and white-light imaging (WLI) in a high-risk population. Methods: In this prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly assigned to optical enhancement mode 2 or WLI groups. Detection of suspicious neoplastic lesions during the examinations was recorded, and pathological diagnoses served as the gold standard. Results: A total of 1211 and 1219 individuals were included in the optical enhancement mode 2 and WLI groups, respectively. The detection rate of neoplastic lesions was significantly higher in the optical enhancement mode 2 group (5.1% vs. 1.9%; risk ratio, 2.656 [95% confidence interval, 1.630-4.330]; p < 0.001). The detection rate of neoplastic lesions with an atrophic gastritis background was significantly higher in the optical enhancement mode 2 group (8.6% vs. 2.6%, p < 0.001).

A single endoscopist who performed the endoscopic procedures completed 1-month training in advanced endoscopy in Japan. Following the training, the endoscopist continued to engage in internet-based discussions regarding his cases encountered. Prior to this training, the endoscopist had not detected any EGC cases during his 12-year gastroenterology practice.Results: A total of 1033 patients were included in the study, with males accounting for 65.4% and a mean age 52 years. The average procedural time was 7.13 +/- 4.8 min. A total of 25 patients (2.4%) were found to have GC, including 6 patients (0.6%) with EGC. Two patients had synchronous EGC lesions. All EGC patients were males, with an average age of 66 years. All EGCs were detected in the distal stomach in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection and severe atrophic gastritis.Conclusion: Our findings showed that the endoscopic detection of EGC is feasible in India.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of H. pylori eradication on gastric polyps. Methods Participants in a large screening cohort underwent baseline and follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy and H. pylori testing. The association between gastric polyps and H. pylori was estimated using odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for confounding factors and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The effect of H. pylori eradication on the fate of polyps was also evaluated. Results The screening cohort included 7603 participants (605 gastric polyps: 529 hyperplastic polyps, 63 fundic gland polyps, and 13 adenomas). H. pylori infection showed a positive association with hyperplastic polyps (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.66-2.41), but was inversely related to fundic gland polyps (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.02-0.17). Removed polyps by biopsy or endoscopic resection or tiny polyps less than 3 mm at baseline and positive conversion of H. pylori at follow-up were excluded. A total of 7060 persons were finally included to evaluate the effect of H. pylori eradication on the gastric polyp. Successful H. pylori eradication (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35-0.77) and persistent H. pylori-negative status (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46-0.76) reduced the risk of hyperplastic polyps compared with the persistent H. pylori-positive group. Successful H. pylori eradication markedly induced the disappearance of hyperplastic polyps compared with the persistent H. pylori-positive group (85.0 vs. 29.0%, P=0.001).

However, this indicator is difficult to measure and audit manually in clinical practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology that may solve this problem. Methods A deep learning model with an accuracy of 96.64% was developed from 15,305 images for upper endoscopy anatomy classification in the unit. Endoscopy images for asymptomatic patients receiving screening endoscopy were evaluated with this model to assess the completeness of photodocumentation rate. Results A total of 15,723 images from 472 upper endoscopies performed by 12 endoscopists were enrolled. The complete photodocumentation rate from the pharynx to the duodenum was 53.8% and from the esophagus to the duodenum was 78.0% in this study. Endoscopists with a higher adenoma detection rate had a higher complete examination rate from the pharynx to duodenum (60.0% vs. 38.7%, P < 0.0001) and from esophagus to duodenum (83.0% vs. 65.7%, P < 0.0001) compared with endoscopists with lower adenoma detection rate. The pharynx, gastric angle, gastric retroflex view, gastric antrum, and the first portion of duodenum are likely to be missed by endoscopists with lower adenoma detection rates.

Design 968 breath samples were collected from 484 patients (including 99 with GC) for two different analyses. The first sample was analysed by gas chromatography linked to mass spectrometry (GCMS) while applying t test with multiple corrections (p value<0.017); the second by cross-reactive nanoarrays combined with pattern recognition. For the latter, 70% of the samples were randomly selected and used in the training set while the remaining 30% constituted the validation set. The operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia (OLGIM) assessment staging system was used to stratify the presence/absence and risk level of precancerous lesions. Patients with OLGIM stages III-IV were considered to be at high risk. Results According to the GCMS results, patients with cancer as well as those at high risk had distinctive breath-print compositions. Eight significant volatile organic compounds (p value<0.017) were detected in exhaled breath in the different comparisons. The nanoarray analysis made it possible to discriminate between the patients with GC and the control group (OLGIM 0-IV) with 73% sensitivity, 98% specificity and 92% accuracy.

Methods An integrative analysis combining data derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and cBioPortal databases was performed to investigate the potential molecular biomarker. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions were used to measure the expression of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein by OLFM4. In combination with the gastroscopic findings and the OLFM4 expression in GIM-GC, a predictive model was established. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was applied to assess the diagnostic value of the model for GIM-GC. Results According to the GEO and cBioPortal databases, OLFM4 was identified as a key gene in the diagnosis of GIM-GC. Higher protein expression of OLFM4 was found in GIM and GIM-GC compared with chronic superficial gastritis (GS) (p < 0.05). The positive expression rate of OLFM4 in paracancerous tissue (GCP) was higher than in GIM (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between GIM-GC and GCP (p > 0.05).

Laboratory data and demographic data were collected. A derivation cohort (n=395) was used to identify the factors associated with GPLs to develop a predictive model. Then, internal validation was performed (n=168). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to determine the discriminative ability of the predictive model; we constructed a calibration plot to evaluate the accuracy of the predictive model; and we performed decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess the clinical practicability predictive model.Results Four -predictors (i.e., age, body mass index, smoking status, and -triglycerides) were included in the predictive model. The AUC values of this predictive model were 0.715 (95% CI: 0.665-0.765) and 0.717 (95% CI: 0.640-0.795) in the derivation and internal validation cohorts, respectively. These values indicated that the predictive model had good discrimination ability. The calibration plots and DCA suggested that the predictive model had good accuracy and clinical net benefit.

Methods The levels of pepsinogens I and II, gastrin-17, and Helicobacter pylori immunoglobulin antibodies in plasma samples of gastric cancer patients were evaluated using the GastroPanel test system (Biohit Oyj, Helsinki, Finland). A decreased level of the pepsinogen I/II ratio was defined as less than three, while a decrease in gastrin-17 was defined as less than 1 pmol/L. Univariate analysis using non-parametric tests was used to investigate differences between normal and low concentrations of biomarkers. Results In total, 481 plasma samples from patients (59.9% male) with a median age of 64years (ranging from 27 to 88years) were analyzed. Out of the 400 cases of gastric cancer (83.2% of the total), 182 were categorized as the intestinal type, 141 as the diffuse type, 60 as the mixed type, and 17 as indeterminate according to the Lauren classification system. The H. pylori immunoglobulin test was positive in 74.0% of the patients. Pepsinogen I/II ratio was decreased in 32.4% (36.8% of the intestinal type); gastrin-17 in 12.3% (10.1% of the antral region) of all cases. Conclusion The majority of gastric cancer patients had normal levels of pepsinogen and gastrin-17, suggesting that these biomarkers have limited application as screening tools in the Caucasian population.

Measurements C-1019T RsaI and T7678A DraI genotyping of CYP2E1 gene; direct sequencing. Results This study reveals that the variant c2 allele and carrier with at least one c2 allele of C-1019T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly increased the risk of GIC but no significant association was found between T7678A SNP and combined analysis of C-1019T and T7678A SNPs to risk of GIC. The Malaysian Chinese had greater risk of GIC compared with the Malays, Indians and KadazanDusun. An increased risk of GIC was observed in individuals aged >40years and women had a 2.22-fold and 1.58-fold increased risk of stomach and colorectal cancers, respectively, when compared with men. Limitations The future research should be conducted with a larger sample population and including the gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions. Conclusions Our study suggests that the rare c2 allele and carrier with at least one c2 allele of CYP2E1 RsaI polymorphism significantly elevated the risk of GIC and may be used as a genetic biomarker for early screening of GIC in Malaysians.

We aimed to identify immune infiltrating cell-related biomarkers in early gastric cancer (EGC) progression.Methods The GSE55696 and GSE130823 datasets with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN), and EGC samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to perform an observational study. Immune infiltration analysis was performed by single sample gene set enrichment analysis and Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to explore the co-expression modules and genes, and further enrichment analysis was performed on these genes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of these genes was constructed to identify biomarkers associated with EGC progression. Screened hub genes were validated by the rank sum test and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Results Immune scores were significantly elevated in EGC samples compared to LGIN and HGIN samples. The green-yellow module exhibited the strongest correlation with both immune score and disease progression. The 87 genes within this module were associated with the chemokine signaling pathways, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and Ras signaling pathways. Through PPI network analysis, the hub genes identified were protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type C (PTPRC), pleckstrin, CD53, CD48, lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1), hematopoietic cell-specific Lyn substrate 1, IKAROS Family Zinc Finger 1, Bruton tyrosine kinase, and Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1. Notably, CD48, LCP1, and PTPRC showed high expression levels in EGC samples, with the remaining hub genes demonstrating a similar expression trend.Conclusion This study identified 9 immune cell-related biomarkers that may be actively involved in the progression of EGC and serve as potential targets for GC diagnosis and treatment.",2024,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,1.53303E+16,,1.53303E+16,23,,Technol.

The gene LAMC2 encodes the laminin subunit gamma-2 chain and is found specifically in the basement membrane of epithelial cells. Its expression is aberrant in multiple types of malignant tumors. This research elucidated a link between LAMC2 and the clinical characteristics of GC and investigated the potential involvement of LAMC2 in GC proliferation and advancement.Materials and methods LAMC2 expressions were detected in GC cell lines and normal gastric epithelial cell lines via qRT-PCR. Silencing and overexpression of the LAMC2 were conducted by lentiviral transfection. A xenograft mouse model was also developed for in vivo analysis. Cell functional assays were conducted to elucidate the involvement of LAMC2 in cell growth, migration, and penetration. Further, immunoblotting was conducted to investigate the impact of LAMC2 on the activation of signal pathways after lentiviral transfection.Results In the findings, LAMC2 expression was markedly upregulated in GC cell lines as opposed to normal gastric epithelial cells. In vitro analysis showed that sh-LAMC2 substantially inhibited GC cell growth, migration, and invasion, while oe-LAMC2 displayed a contrasting effect. Xenograft tumor models demonstrated that oe-LAMC2 accelerated tumor growth via high expression of Ki-67. Immunoblotting analysis revealed a substantial decrease in various signaling pathway proteins, PI3K, p-Akt, and Vimentin levels upon LAMC2 knockdown, followed by increased E-cadherin expression. Conversely, its overexpression exhibited contrasting effects. Besides, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was accelerated by LAMC2.Conclusion This study provides evidence indicating that LAMC2, by stimulating signaling pathways, facilitated EMT and stimulated the progression of GC cells in laboratory settings and mouse models.

However, the existence of missed lesions has been frequently discussed. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at assessing the magnitude of missing GC diagnosis with EGD and its predictive factors. Methods MEDLINE was searched to identify all studies assessing and reporting the proportion of missed GC diagnosis with EGD. Pooled proportion and negative predictive values were computed using the random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q-test and I-2. Results The studies included (n = 22) were grouped by study design. The pooled negative predictive value was 99.7% (95% confidence interval 99.6-99.9%). Missed GCs proportion was 9.4% (95% confidence interval 5.7-13.1%), being 10.0% in studies including patients with negative EGD followed over time, 8.3% in studies including patients with GC, and 23.3% in studies evaluating the proportion of missed synchronous lesions. Mainly, missed cancers were located in the gastric body both in Eastern and in Western studies (39 and 47%, respectively). The majority of missed GCs were adenocarcinomas. Younger age (<55 years), female sex, marked gastric atrophy, gastric adenoma or ulcer, and inadequate number of biopsy fragments were reported as predictive factors for diagnostic failure. Conclusion EGD is a very effective method to rule out GC. However, missing GC with EGD is not uncommon, with one out of 10 cancers being potentially missed. Interestingly, lesions were more often missed in the body and therefore a more rigorous protocol for endoscopy and biopsy should be implemented worldwide.

However, most early cancers are challenging to detect because of subtle morphological or color differences from surrounding atrophic mucosa and intestinal metaplasia. Linked color imaging (LCI) enhances mucosal color difference, making it easier to detect EGCs. The aim of this study is to clarify the advantages and possible disadvantages of LCI for screening for obscure EGC. Methods A total of 665 malignant gastric lesions resected using endoscopic submucosal dissection between January 2015 and April 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Obviously detectable lesions were not included in the main analysis when determining the target lesion. White light imaging (WLI)/LCI images of 508 endoscopically obscure malignant lesions were included in the final analysis and evaluated by three non-expert and three expert endoscopists using visibility scores for detection and extent. Results The detection visibility scores using LCI were significantly higher than those using WLI regardless of lesion characteristics including location, size, histological type, depth of invasion, and Helicobacter pylori status. The detection score improved in 46.4% cases and deteriorated in 4.9% when the modality changed from WLI to LCI. A mixed-effects multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that use of LCI (odds ratio [OR] 2.57), elevated type (OR 1.92), invasion to submucosa (OR 2.18) were significantly associated with improved visibility of EGC.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether repeated esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) screening is an effective method for detecting EGC that can be treated by endoscopic resection. Methods For patients diagnosed with gastric cancer in the Korean National Cancer Center screening program, we analyzed the incidence of gastric cancer, clinicopathological characteristics, and treatment modality according to whether they had (repeated screening group) or not (infrequent screening group) undergone EGD screening within 2 years before diagnosis. Results Of the 18414 patients who underwent EGD, 81 (0.44%) were found to have gastric cancer. Incidence of gastric cancer in repeated screening group was lower than that of infrequent screening group (multiple adjusted odds ratio=0.45, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.77, P=0.004). The proportion of EGCs was 96% (25 of 26) n the repeated screening group and 71% (34 of 48) in the infrequent screening group (P=0.01). Mean (SD) tumor size was smaller [1.9 (1.2) vs. 3.0 (1.6) cm, P=0.01] and the proportion of intramucosal cancer was higher [81% (21 of 26) vs. 50% (24 of 48), P=0.02] in the former than in the latter. Endoscopic resection was performed more frequently in the repeated screening group [54% (14 of 26) vs. 23% (11 of 48), P=0.007].

Recently, artificial intelligence based on deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has enabled significant advancements in the field of gastroenterology. However, it remains unclear whether a CNN can outperform endoscopists. In this study, we evaluated whether the performance of a CNN in detecting early gastric cancer is better than that of endoscopists. Methods The CNN was constructed using 13,584 endoscopic images from 2639 lesions of gastric cancer. Subsequently, its diagnostic ability was compared to that of 67 endoscopists using an independent test dataset (2940 images from 140 cases). Results The average diagnostic time for analyzing 2940 test endoscopic images by the CNN and endoscopists were 45.5 +/- 1.8 s and 173.0 +/- 66.0 min, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the CNN were 58.4%, 87.3%, 26.0%, and 96.5%, respectively. These values for the 67 endoscopists were 31.9%, 97.2%, 46.2%, and 94.9%, respectively. The CNN had a significantly higher sensitivity than the endoscopists (by 26.5%; 95% confidence interval, 14.9-32.5%).

Analysis of saliva may provide a non-invasive approach for detection of malignancies in organs associated with the oral cavity. This research aims to analyze salivary microRNA expression together with clinical and demographic features with the aim of diagnosing gastric cancer.MaterialsThe study included 19 patients with early-stage gastric cancer and 19 healthy controls. Saliva samples were collected and processed for RNA isolation. Salivary expression of miR-223-3p and miR-21-5p were measured using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic models. Machine learning algorithms, multiple logistic regression, and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to assess the predictive power of miRNAs in conjunction with clinical-demographic features.ResultsSignificant upregulation of miR-223-3p and downregulation of miR-21-5p in saliva were observed in patients with gastric cancer. The area under ROC curve (AUC) values for salivary miR-21-5p, salivary miR-223-3p, and their multiple logistic regression were determined to be 0.723, 0.791, and 0.850, respectively. The AUC for multiple logistic regression model was 0.919. The PCA model led to the highest diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 134.33 (sensitivity = 0.785, specificity = 1.00, AUC = 903). Application of machine learning methods, and in particular a random forest algorithm, showed high accuracy in diagnosing patients with gastric cancer (sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.857, AUC = 0.93).ConclusionThe application of validated salivary diagnostics in clinical practice could help facilitate earlier diagnosis of gastric cancer and improve medical outcome.

Innovative and non-invasive cancer screening technologies, such as N-NOSE, can improve early detection. N-NOSE is a urine-based scent test that leverages the olfactory abilities of the nematode C. elegans. For the first time, this prospective study evaluates the efficacy of the N-NOSE chemotaxis index as a novel biomarker for postoperative surveillance and recurrence in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers.MethodsA two-year prospective cohort study was conducted at The University of Tokyo Hospital, involving 40 patients with gastric and esophageal cancers. Urine samples were collected pre- and postoperatively and analysed using the N-NOSE technique.ResultsIn cases of recurrence with vascular invasion, the chemotaxis index at 100-fold urine dilution was significantly elevated compared to the non-recurrence group.ConclusionThis study suggests the potential of N-NOSE as an effective follow-up tool for patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer, particularly those with vascular invasion.

This study aimed to estimate the clinical benefits, harms, cost, and cost-effectiveness of the GCRSS screening strategy from a Chinese healthcare system perspective. Materials and methodsUsing a microsimulation model, we evaluated 7 screening scenarios of the GCRSS with varying starting ages. We simulated 100,000 individuals from the age of 20 for each screening scenario. The main outcomes included GC incidence reduction, number of cause-specific deaths, costs, quality-adjusted life year (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and benefit-to-harm ratio. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done to explore the robustness of model findings. ResultsScreening with the GCRSS strategy at the age of 40 years (40-GCRSS) provided the greatest reduction of GC incidence by 70.6%, with 7,374 GC deaths averted per 100,000 individuals and the lowest benefit-to-harm ratio of 0.392. Compared with no screening or previous less costly strategy, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $37,655 per QALY, the 40-GCRSS strategy was cost-effective, with ICERs of $12,586 and $29,115 per QALY, respectively. Results were robust across univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The 40-GCRSS strategy showed a 0.856 probability of being cost-effective at a $37,655 per QALY WTP threshold. ConclusionsThe findings suggest that the GCRSS strategy is effective and cost-effective in reducing the GC disease burden in China from a Chinese healthcare system perspective.

We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the WC as an adjunct to conventional images in detecting early gastric cancer (EGC). Materials and methods: Thirty-nine patients with 43 EGCs underwent contrast-enhanced MDCT gastrography for preoperative examination. Two observers independently reviewed the images under three different conditions: term 1, Axial CT; term 2, Axial CT, MPR and VE; and term 3, Axial CT, MPR, VE and WC for the detection of EGC. The accuracy of each condition as reviewed by each of the two observers was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Interobserver agreement was calculated using weighted-kappa statistics. Results: The best diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement were obtained in term 3. The AUCs of the two observers for terms 1, 2, and 3 were 0.63, 0.73, and 0.84, and 0.57, 0.73, and 0.76, respectively. The interobserver agreement improved from fair at term 1 to substantial at term 3. Conclusions: The addition of WC to conventional MDCT display improved the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver reproducibility for the detection of ECG.

Methods: Literature published before May 2024 that utilized ME-NBI for diagnosing EGC was searched across PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and major Chinese databases. Included studies were cohort studies or randomized controlled trials, and their quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 framework. Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 17 software to calculate diagnostic indicators such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Heterogeneity was explored through Spearman's correlation coefficient, I-2 statistics, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression analysis. Publication bias was assessed with Deeks' funnel plot. Results: Twenty studies involving 7,770 patients and 7,917 lesions were included. The pooled sensitivity of ME-NBI for diagnosing EGC was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.90), specificity was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.96), and the AUC was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91-0.96), demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy. Subgroup analysis revealed lower sensitivity in multicenter studies. Excised samples had similar sensitivity to biopsy samples but differed in specificity. Publication bias was detected (P=0.01), but sensitivity analysis corrected for this, maintaining high combined sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. Conclusion: ME-NBI is a highly accurate and reliable diagnostic tool for EGC. Despite have some bias and heterogeneity, this was effectively addressed through sensitivity and subgroup analyses.

Methods: TRIM58 expression in GC tissues and cells was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot, followed by lentiviral-induced overexpression or knockdown of TRIM58. Subsequently, CCK8, BrdU-ELISA, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, in vitro animal experiments and immunochemistry were performed to explore the function of TRIM58. Western blotting was used to detect beta-catenin, C-myc, Cyclin D1, and survivin expression. Results: TRIM58 expression was significantly reduced in tumor tissues of GC patients and GC cell lines, whereas beta-catenin, C-myc, Cyclin D1, and survivin were highly expressed. Overexpression of TRIM58 in GC cells resulted in decreases in beta-catenin, C-myc, Cyclin D1, and survivin protein expression and significantly suppressed proliferation by preventing cell-cycle progression and promoting cell apoptosis. Conversely, TRIM58 knockdown resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, the effect of TRIM58 knockdown on GC cells was potently reversed by a beta-catenin inhibitor, XAV939. Immunoprecipitations showed the interaction between TRIM58 and beta-catenin, and TRIM58 overexpression significantly enhanced beta-catenin degradation. In addition, we found a significant decrease in the growth and weight of tumors and an increase in tumor cell apoptosis in TRIM58-overexpression nude mice, which were also accompanied by reduced beta-catenin expression. Conclusions: These data suggest that TRIM58 may function as a tumor suppressor in GC and potentially suppress the tumor growth of gastric cancer by inactivation of beta-catenin signaling via ubiquitination.",2020/3/3,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:04,,203-212,,3,21,,Cancer Biol.

Methods: A cross-sectional study, performed with dyspeptic patients referred for an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The association between the family history of gastric cancer and the findings of the endoscopic examination was verified using the Chi-square or Fisher tests, and its effect was shown using odds ratio and confidence interval in univariate and multivariate analyses. Logistic regression was used to analyze the data. Results: Among the 751 dyspeptic patients enrolled, 44 (5.9%) had a family history of gastric cancer, mostly females (70.5%) aged 45 years or older (56.8%).

Methods: A total of 520 patients were enrolled after the examination of endoscopy at Endoscopy Center, Department of Gastroenterology, from June 2018 to December 2021. The patients were divided into three groups according to age, gender, serum helicobacter pylori antibody test, pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), pepsinogen I/II ratio (PGR) and gastrin-17 test results before endoscopy: Group A defined as low-risk group (0-11 points), Group B defined as middle-risk group (12-16 points), Group C defined as high-risk group (17-23 points). The detection rates of gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis in three groups were analyzed. According to the range and degree of atrophy/intestinal metaplasia, patients were divided into five groups on the basis of OLGA/OLGIM staging system. The levels of PG I, PG II and PGR were compared between different groups, and the correlation between new gastric cancer screening score system and OLGA/OLGIM staging system were evaluated. Statistical analysis was accomplished by ANOVA, chi-square test and Gamma coefficient analysis. Results: A total of 520 patients were enrolled. 268 patients were classified into group A,222 patients into group B and 30 patients into group C, respectively. According to the pathological results, 281 cases were non-atrophic gastritis, 230 cases atrophic gastritis and 9 cases gastric cancer. For OLGA staging system, 281 patients were divided into stage-0 group, 121 patients into stage-I group, 72 patients into stage-II group, 33 patients into stage-III group and 13 patients into stage-IV groups. The PGI and PGR level correlated inversely with the rising OLGA stages (F = 3.028, p = .016, F = 6.036, p < .001). For OLGIM staging system, 252 patients were divided into stage-0 group, 137 patients into stage-I group, 80 patients into stage-II group, 36 patients into stage-III group and 15 patients into stage-IV group. The PGR level correlated inversely with the rising OLGIM stages (F = 3.466, p=.007). The detection rates of gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis in Group C were much higher than other groups. (X-2 = 14.727, p < .001; X-2 = 51.280, p < .001). Gamma coefficient analysis showed significant correlations between OLGA/OLGIM and the new gastric cancer screening score system (p < .001).

The diagnostic value of these biomarkers was analyzed through sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve assessments.; Results: Serum PGI levels were significantly lower in patients with advanced gastric cancer compared to those with early gastric cancer (P < .05), while PGII and G-17 levels were significantly higher in advanced-stage patients (P < .05). The combined ROC curve analysis of PGI, PGII, and G-17 yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.933, indicating higher diagnostic accuracy than any of the markers alone. Statistically significant differences were noted between the combined and individual tests (Z = 2.376, P < .05). Patients with PGI levels lower than 17.21 ng/ml had a worse prognosis compared to those with higher levels. Similarly, patients with PGII levels greater than 74.65 ng/ml and G-17 levels greater than 17.03 pmol/L had poorer prognoses. Additionally, higher G-17 levels were associated with significantly lower serum PGI levels.; Conclusions: Patients with low expression of PGI have a poorer prognosis, and those with high expression of PGII and G-17 also have a poor prognosis. Combining the three indicators has clear value for the screening and prognostic evaluation of gastric cancer, making it worthy of clinical promotion and application.",2024,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:16,,,,9,30,,Altern.

Methods: A gastric cancer risk scoring system (GC-RSS) was developed based on questionnaire-based predictors for gastric cancer derived from systematic literature review. To assess the capability of this system for discrimination, risk scores for 8,214 and 7,235 outpatient subjects accepting endoscopic examination in two endoscopy centers, and 32,630 participants in a community-based cohort in China were calculated to plot receiver operating characteristic curves and generate area under the curve (AUC). To evaluate the performance of GC-RSS, the screening proportion, sensitivity and detection rate ratio compared to universal screening were used under different risk score cutoff values. Results: GC-RSS comprised nine predictors including advanced age, male gender, low body mass index (<18.5 kg/m(2)), family history of gastric cancer, cigarette smoking, consumption of alcohol, preference for salty food, irregularity of meals and consumption of preserved food. This tool performed well in determining the risk of malignant gastric lesions with AUCs of 0.763, 0.706 and 0.696 in three validation sets. When subjects with risk scores >5 were evaluated with endoscopy, nearly 50% of these endoscopies could be saved with a detection rate of over 1.5 times achieved. When the cutoff was set at 8, only about 10% of subjects with the highest risk would be offered endoscopy, and detection rates for gastric cancer could be increased 2-4 fold compared to universal screening. Conclusions: An effective questionnaire-based GC-RSS was developed and validated.

In contrast, miR-215 was preferentially upregulated in gastric cancer (GC) according to our data. Thus, we studied the potential biological function of miR-215 in GC. Methods: miR-215 expression was measured in 77 paired GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Biological functions of miR-215 were analyzed using cell viability, colony formation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, apoptosis and luciferase assays as well as via tumorigenicity and metastasis analysis. Results: miR-215 was significantly upregulated in 7 GC cell lines and 77 GC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues (P < 0.05), and miR-215 expression was greater in advanced GC (stage III/IV; P < 0.05). Ectopic expression of miR-215 in GES-1 and HGC-27 cells (low miR-215 expression) promoted cell growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis, and these were reversed in NCI-N87 cells (high miR-215 expression) after miR-215 downregulation. Potential target genes of miR-215 were predicted and RUNX1, a transcription factor and a tumor suppressor, was confirmed to be potential target according to luciferase studies.

However, its application is restricted in clinical practice due to its invasive property. A new noninvasive population screening process combining the assay of anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody and serum pepsinogen (PG) (ABC method) is adopted to recognize the high-risk patients for further endoscopy examination, avoiding the unnecessary gastroscopy for most population and saving the cost consumption for mass screening annually. Nevertheless, controversies exist for the grouping of ABC method and the intervals of gastroscopy surveillance for each group. In this review, we summarized these popular concerned topics for providing useful references to the healthcare practitioner in clinical practice. Data Sources: The PubMed databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to November 22, 2017, using the keywords ""Helicobacter pylori,"" ""Pepsinogens,"" and ""Stomach Neoplasms."" Study Selection: Original articles and reviews on the topics were selected. Results: Anti-H. pylori antibody and serum PG concentration showed significant changes under the different status of H. pylori infection and the progression of atrophic gastritis, which can be used for risk stratification of gastric cancer in clinic.

Early detection can help reduce mortality rates. Biomarkers are being investigated globally for their potential in disease screening, monitoring, and follow-up in various cancers. However, currently, there is insufficient data on the role of biomarkers in gastric carcinoma. Material and Methods: This single center case control study was conducted from June 2018 to March 2021 from South India. Blood samples were collected from 85 patients diagnosed with gastric carcinoma and 85 apparently healthy individuals serving as the control group. The samples were collected in a fasting state. The serum levels of biomarkers interferon gamma (IFN gamma), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared between the two groups. Additionally, the levels of biomarkers were compared within the gastric cancer group based on disease location, stage, and histotype. Results: The serum levels of IFN gamma and IL-10 were found to be significantly elevated in gastric carcinoma patients compared to the healthy control group. Both biomarkers exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in detecting carcinoma of the stomach. However, there was no significant difference in the serum level of MMP7 between gastric cancer patients and control group.

In this study, we aimed to find a potential biomarker with high accuracy in tRNA-derived small RNAs that can help diagnose GC. Methods: tRF-27-FDXXE6XRK45 was screened as a target molecule by high-throughput sequencing in three pairs of GC tissues. RNA quantitative reverse transcription PCR was conducted to detect the expression levels of tRF-27-FDXXE6XRK45.

However, their stages have not been clarified. We examined the detection rates of various cancers using whole-body PET for the screening of cancers in asymptomatic individuals, focusing on their clinical and pathological stages. Methods: Whole-body PET was obtained as a part of our cancer screening program among 3,426 healthy subjects. All subjects participated in a course of PET examination in conjunction with conventional examinations including a medical questionnaire, tumor markers, immunological fecal occult blood test, neck and abdominal ultrasonography and whole body computed tomography. A diagnosis and staging was obtained by an analysis of the pathological findings or by an analysis of the clinical follow-up data. Results: Malignant tumors were discovered in 65 lesions found in 3,426 participants (1.90%). The PET findings were true-positive in 46 of the 65 cancer cases. The cancers were found in the following organs: the colon 14; thyroid gland 10; stomach 7; lung 5; liver 3; breast 2; and one each in the kidney, gallbladder, esophagus, pancreas and retroperitoneum. The stages were as follows: stage O 5, stage I 17, stage II 10, stage III 7, and stage IV 6. One was an unknown primary. There were 19 false-negative findings (0.6%) on PET.

Treatment of the disease is further aggravated by the lack of diagnostic biomarkers that can aid in the early detection of GC and promote its favorable prognosis. The present work aims to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers for GC. Design and methods: The present work is a case-control study that focuses on proteomic analysis of serum from healthy volunteers and GC patients using ClinProt profiling technology based on mass spectrometry. A pattern of proteins/peptides with the ability to differentiate the studied populations was identified. Deregulated proteins/peptides differentially expressed in the serum of patients compared with healthy volunteers were identified by mass spectroscopy. Results: A pattern of proteins/peptides consisting of four protein/peptide peaks at m/z 1467, 1867, 2701, and 2094 was identified. These protein/peptide peaks were able to differentiate the studied populations with close to 100% sensitivity and specificity. Three of the deregulated proteins/peptides at m/z 1867, 2701, and 2094 were identified by mass spectroscopy (LTQ Orbitrap XL) as tubulin beta chain, thymosin beta-4-like protein 3, and cytochrome b-c(1) complex subunit 1, respectively. Conclusions: The pattern of proteins/peptides identified in the present work shows great potential for GC diagnosis. Deregulated proteins of tubulin beta chain, thymosin beta-4-like protein 3, and cytochrome b-c(1) complex subunit 1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of GC and serve as potential serological diagnostic biomarkers.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic value of DKK1 in the diagnosis of GI cancers. Methods: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WANFANG databases was conducted to identify the related studies published before May 1, 2015, which investigated the diagnostic value of serum DKK1 for GI cancers. The methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 checklist. The diagnostic performance was pooled and analyzed using a bivariate model. Publication bias was evaluated with the Deeks' funnel test. Results: A total of 15 studies with 5,076 participants were finally identified for the meta-analysis. The pooled results of sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio for DKK1 test were 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-0.74), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.89-0.91), 7.72 (95% CI: 4.90-12.14), 0.29 (95% CI: 0.22-0.39), and 28.95 (95% CI: 16.25-51.65) for diagnosis of GI cancers, respectively. The area under the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.8901. The SEN of DKK1 in diagnosis of gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer may be higher than hepatocellular carcinoma, and the SPE in pancreatic cancer subgroup was lower than hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer subgroups. Conclusion: The currently available evidence suggests that serum DKK1 is a potential biomarker with high SEN and SPE for screening GI cancers. To better elucidate the usefulness of serum DKK1, further studies are needed.",2015,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:15,,3115-3122,,,8,,OncoTargets Ther.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: Albany Publisher: Dove Medical Press Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000363167300001,,,,DIAGNOSIS; METASTASIS; EXPRESSION; REGULATOR; cancer screening; gastrointestinal cancer; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; TUMOR; POOR-PROGNOSIS; FAMILY; accuracy; dickkopf-1; DKK1; 1021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of serum tests: serum pepsinogen I (PGI pepsinogen I/II ratio (PGR), gastrin-17 (G-17) and H. pylori-immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to screen atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. METHODS: A total of 458 patients were recruited, and each underwent endoscopy with biopsies before the serum tests were performed. These patients were divided into five groups based on the endoscopic and histological findings: 92 patients in the atrophic gastritis group, 58 in the gastric ulcer group, 90 in the duodenal ulcer group, 141 in the gastric cancer group (40 early gastric cancer and 101 advanced gastric cancer) and 77 (including mild non-atrophic gastritis) served as a control group. Serum samples for PGI and II, G- 17, and H. pylori-IgG antibodies estimation were analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: PGI and PGR values decreased significantly both in atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer groups (P < 0.01). For the best discrimination of atrophic gastritis, the cut-off values of PGI and PGR were 82.3 mu g/L and 6.05, respectively. The PGI, PGR and G- 17 values were related significantly with the grades and/or sites of atrophic gastritis (P < 0.01). Patients with atrophic corpus gastritis had low PGI and PGR values and high G-17 level, and patients with atrophic antral gastritis had low G-17 level. G-17 increased significantly in the gastric cancer group (P < 0.01). PGI and PGR values were significantly lower in patients with advanced gastric cancer than in patients with early gastric cancer, while there was no difference in G-17 level between them. The positivity rate of H. pylori-IgG antibodies was 54.55% in the control group. The PGI level was higher in H. pylori positive patients than in H. pylori negative ones (P < 0.001), while there was no difference in G-17 level between them. The positivity rates of H. pylori-IgG antibodies were over 85% in all other four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum PGI PGR and G-17 values are biomarkers of atrophic antral gastritis. Atrophic corpus gastritis can be screened by lower serum PGI, PGR and high G-17 values. [Correction added after online publication on 2 February 2007: the preceding sentence has replaced one that read 'Atrophic be screened by serum PGI and PGR values']. Gastric cancer can be screened on the basis of increased serum G-17 and remarkedly low serum PGI and PGR values.

This study constructed a model for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer by comparing the serum peptides profiles of patients with advanced gastric cancer and healthy people. And that model may be the potential to be applied for the efficacy evaluation and recurrence monitoring in gastric cancer.Methods. Serums of 30 healthy people and 30 advanced gastric cancer patients were matched by age and gender were collected. The serum peptide spectrum was obtained by MB-WCX concentration and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Based on the analysis of the efficiency of differential peptides in the diagnosis of gastric cancer, we first established a model for the diagnosis of gastric cancer based on differential peptides and then carried out external verification. The diagnostic reliability of this model was further tested by compared with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9).Results. In this present study, we found the expression of two peptide peaks with a molecular weight of 2863 Da and 2953 Da were significantly increased in gastric cancer serum, while the expression of two peptide peaks with a molecular weight of 1945 Da and 2082 Da were significantly decreased. Depending on the characteristics of peptide expression, we constructed a diagnostic model, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the model established by 2953 Da/1945 Da, and found this model is significantly higher than CEA and CA19-9.Conclusion. There were some differences in serum peptides profiles between patients with advanced gastric cancer and healthy people. The serum peptide diagnostic models based on 2953 Da and 1945 Da have high diagnostic efficiency for advanced gastric cancer.

Since early diagnosis is very important for treating gastric cancer (GC), we aimed to detect serum small proline-rich protein2A (SPRR2A) to verify its diagnostic value for GC patients.Methods. Serum samples were collected from 200 patients with GC, 100 patients with gastritis, 40 patients with rectal cancer (RC), 50 patients with colon cancer (CC), and 100 healthy controls. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection kit was applied to measure serum SPRR2A concentration. The correlations between serum SPRR2A and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), clinical pathological parameters of GC, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were also analyzed.Results. The median serum SPRR2A concentration in GC patients was significantly higher than those in healthy controls and gastritis or colorectal cancer patients (P<0.001). Serum SPRR2A concentration at a cut-off value of 80.7 pg/ml yielded an AUC of 0.851, with 75.7% sensitivity and 74.5% specificity for discriminating GC patients from healthy people. The AUC for the serum SPRR2A concentration combined with the CEA concentration was 0.876, with 79.7% sensitivity and 78.7% specificity. Similarly, serum SPRR2A discriminated GC patients from gastritis patients with an AUC of 0.820, with 90.5% sensitivity and 61.7% specificity. The AUC for the serum SPRR2A concentration combined with the CEA concentration was 0.848, with 87.8% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity. The serum SPRR2A levels in GC patients were associated with lymph node metastasis and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P<0.05). There was an obvious difference in serum SPRR2A expression between GC patients before and after surgery (P<0.0001).Conclusion.

Although commonly practiced in Japan, the effectiveness of regular screening with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy against gastric cancer has not been well evidenced. The aim of the study was to investigate if gastric cancer-related mortality can be reduced by regular endoscopy. Material and methods. The medical records of 833 patients with gastric ulcer (GU) and 2547 without ulcer (NU) were analyzed; these patients received long-term, repeated endoscopic examinations between 1969 and 2004. Gastric cancer incidence, death by gastric cancer, and overall survival were compared with those in a Japanese general population by calculating the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Results. The interval between UGI endoscopic examinations was 1.4 +/- 1.4 years in the GU group and 1.8 +/- 1.5 years in the NU group. During follow-up, 32 patients with GU and 61 in the NU group developed gastric cancer, showing annual incidence rates of 0.40% (95% CI: 0.24-0.56%) and 0.38% (0.28-0.48%), and SIRs of 2.21 (1.44-2.98) and 1.72 (1.29-2.15), respectively. The 5-year survival rate exceeded 80% among patients who developed gastric cancer.

Design Using a cohort of Chinese men and women born during 1951-1980, we assumed that different prevention strategies were conducted, including eradication of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and endoscopy screening (one-time, annual, biennial, triennial or stratified according to personal risk). We performed a literature search to identify up-to-date data and populate a Markov model to project the number of new GC cases and deaths during 2021-2035, as well as resource requirements and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We examined the impacts of general (among the whole population) and targeted (high-risk population) prevention. Results During 2021-2035, 10.0 million new GC cases and 5.6 million GC deaths would occur, with 7.6%-35.5% and 6.9%-44.5%, respectively, being avoidable through various prevention strategies. Relative to the status quo, Hp eradication was a cost-saving strategy. General annual screening dominated other screening strategies, but cost more than CNY 70 000 per QALY gained (willingness-to-pay) compared with Hp eradication. Among endoscopy strategies, targeted screening resulted in 44%-49% lower cost per QALY gained over the status quo than general screening. Among high-risk population, tailoring the screening frequency according to personal risk could reduce endoscopy-related resources by 22% compared with biennial screening and by 55% compared with annual screening, Conclusion Our findings provide important input for future decision-making and investment, highlighting the need and feasibility for China to include GC prevention in its national health plans.",Dec-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:55,,2391-2400,,12,71,,Gut,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: London Publisher: BMJ Publishing Group Web of Science ID: WOS:000834948000001,,,,RISK; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI; SURVIVAL; CANCER PREVENTION; GASTRIC CANCER; SCREENING; ERADICATION; GUIDELINES; INFECTION; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; 308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods A prospective, longitudinal and multicentre study was carried out in Singapore. The study participants comprised 2980 patients undergoing screening gastroscopy with standardised gastric mucosal sampling, from January 2004 and December 2010, with scheduled surveillance endoscopies at year 3 and 5. Participants were also matched against the National Registry of Diseases Office for missed diagnoses of early gastric neoplasia (EGN). Results There were 21 participants diagnosed with EGN. IM was a significant risk factor for EGN (adjusted-HR 5.36; 95% CI 1.51 to 19.0; p<0.01). The age-adjusted EGN incidence rates for patients with and without IM were 133.9 and 12.5 per 100 000 person-years. Participants with OLGIM stages III-IV were at greatest risk (adjusted-HR 20.7; 95% CI 5.04 to 85.6; p<0.01). More than half of the EGNs (n=4/7) attributed to baseline OLGIM III-IV developed within 2 years (range: 12.7-44.8 months). Serum trefoil factor 3 distinguishes (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics 0.749) patients with OLGIM III-IV if they are negative for H. pylori.

Study selection Articles were selected if they involved clinicopathologic factors, detection methods, and treatment strategies of recurrence of gastric cancer. Results Peritoneal recurrence is the most common pattern in recurrence of gastric cancer. The main risk factors for recurrence of gastric cancer are tumor stage, including depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis, and Borrmann classification. The prognosis of patients with recurrence is very poor, especially patients with peritoneal recurrence. Systemic chemotherapy is still the main treatment method for patients with recurrent cancer. If complete resection can be accomplished, some benefits may be obtained from surgery for recurrence. However, standard treatment for patients with recurrence has not yet been established. Conclusions Early detection and diagnosis of recurrence is quite crucial for treatment and prognosis. The optimal therapeutic strategy for recurrence should be based on a multidisciplinary assessment and the patient's individual state and should involve combined therapy.

Methods Gastric juice was collected from 101 participants who underwent endoscopy in the Outpatient Endoscopy Center of Peking University Third Hospital. The participants were divided into three groups: the normal mucosa or chronic non-atrophic gastritis (NM-CNAG) group (n=35), advanced gastric cancer (AGC) group (n=33) and EGC group (n=33). Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis was performed in all the gastric juice samples and the maximum fluorescence intensity of the first peak (P1FI) was measured. Results The mean fluorescence intensity of P1FI of gastric juice in AGC (92.1 +/- 10.7) and EGC (90.8 +/- 12.0) groups was significantly higher than that in the NM-CNAG group (55.7 +/- 7.5) (AGCvsNM-CNAG, P=0.006 and EGCvsNM-CNAG, P=0.015, respectively). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the detection of AGC and EGC were 0.681 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5530.810, P=0.010) and 0.655 (95% CI 0.5220.787, P=0.028). With the P1FI of 47.7, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting EGC were 69.7%, 57.1% and 63.2%, respectively.

Design A cross-sectional study was conducted of diagnostic gastroscopies between 1 March 2019 and 29 February 2020 using the UK National Endoscopy Database. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were used, incorporating random (endoscopist) and fixed (symptoms, age and sex) effects on two dependent variables (endoscopic cancer; Barrett's oesophagus (BO) diagnosis). Adjusted positive predictive values (aPPVs) were calculated. Results 382 370 diagnostic gastroscopies were analysed; 30.4% were performed in patients aged <50 and 57.7% on female patients. The overall unadjusted PPV for cancer was 1.0% (males 1.7%; females 0.6%, p<0.01). Other major pathology was found in 9.1% of procedures, whereas 89.9% reported only normal findings or minor pathology (92.5% in females; 94.6% in patients <50).

The novel lncRNA DEPDC1 antisense RNA 1 (DEPDC1-AS1) was recently associated with poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. However, its role in regulating the malignant progression of gastric cancer (GC) and its molecular mechanism are unclear. We herein explored the functions of DEPDC1-AS1 in GC progression. Methods DEPDC1-AS1 expression and prognosis in GC tissues were examined by bioinformatics analysis and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The DEPDC1-AS1 function in GC cells was explored by the cell counting kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, Transwell assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling, 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine-incorporation, and the xenograft tumor model. The DEPDC1-AS1 and human antigen (Hu)R interaction was determined by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation. Results DEPDC1-AS1 was overexpressed in GC tissues and cell lines, and associated with a worse prognosis in GC patients. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that DEPDC1-AS1 promoted HGC-27 cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, DEPDC1-AS1 served as a scaffold by combining with HuR to target the specific mRNA F11R.

After extracting the RNA from tissues and serum samples of patients, suffering from colon and gastric cancer, cDNA was synthesized. Then by performing quantitative real-time PCR, we evaluated the expression level of miR-9-5p and miR-192-5p in collected samples. Results Unlike to colon cancer in which the expression level of miR-9-5p remained unchanged, the relative expression of this miRNA decreased remarkably in gastric cancer (with P value < 0.05), in comparison with normal adjacent tissues. In agreement with this finding, we also found that the expression level of miR-192-5p was decreased in gastric cancer tissues, compared to normal gastric tissue.

Whether advanced imaging methods, such as second-generation narrow band imaging (2G-NBI) can improve early detection, is unknown. Design This open-label, randomised, controlled tandem trial was conducted in 13 hospitals. Patients at increased risk for gastric cancer were randomly assigned to primary white light imaging (WLI) followed by secondary 2G-NBI (WLI group: n=2258) and primary 2G-NBI followed by secondary WLI (2G-NBI group: n=2265) performed by the same examiner. Suspected early gastric cancer (EGC) lesions in both groups were biopsied. Primary endpoint was the rate of EGC patients in the primary examination. The main secondary endpoint was the positive predictive value (PPV) for EGC in suspicious lesions detected (primary examination). Results EGCs were found in 44 (1.9%) and 53 (2.3%; p=0.412) patients in the WLI and 2G-NBI groups, respectively, during primary EGD. In a post hoc analysis, the overall rate of lesions detected at the second examination was 25% (n=36/145), with no significant differences between groups.

Conclusion The overall sensitivity of primary endoscopy for the detection of EGC in high-risk patients was only 75% and should be improved. 2G-NBI did not increase EGC detection rate over conventional WLI.

Gastrointestinal tract of the patients can be observed by endoscopy and this technology can be used to diagnose gastric diseases. Gastric lesions are divided into three categories: Advanced Gastric Cancer (AGC), Early Gastric Cancer (EGC), and Gastric Precursor Disease (GPD). Early detection of these types of lesions can be helpful for cancer prevention and for this reason, detection accuracy is of great importance. Since endoscopic procedures are operator-dependent and human factors based processes, there is a high probability of error which by designing an intelligent system based on convolutional neural networks, different types of lesions and diseases can be classified more accurately. In the proposal system, the convolutional neural network model is trained by designing a convolutional neural network architecture and using data augmentation, dropout, noise and weight decay techniques. Using performance criteria such as accuracy, cost, and confusion matrix, the performance of this model is evaluated.

GC is a heterogenic disease with various distinct genetic and epigenetic events that occur during the multifactorial cascade of carcinogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are commonly deregulated in gastric mucosa during the Helicobacter pylori infection and in stepwise manner from chronic gastritis, through preneoplastic conditions such as atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, to early dysplasia and invasive cancer.

Aim of the study was to establish a neural network model based on patient demographic data and serum biomarker panels to aid gastric cancer diagnosis. A total of 295 patients hospitalized in Nanjing Drum Tower hospital diagnosed with gastric cancer based on tissue biopsy, and 423 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Demographical information and tumor biomarkers were obtained from Hospital Information System (HIS) as original data. Pearson's correlation analysis was applied on 574 individuals' data (training set, 229 patients and 345 healthy volunteers) to analyze the relationship between each variable and the final diagnostic result. And independent sample t test was used to detect the differences of the variables. Finally, a neural network model based on 14 relevant variables was constructed. The model was tested on the validation set (144 individuals including 66 patients and 78 healthy volunteers). The predictive ability of the proposed model was compared with other common machine learning models including logistic regression and random forest. Tumor markers contributing significantly to gastric cancer screening included CA199, CA125, AFP, and CA242 were identified, which might be considered as important inspection items for gastric cancer screening.

Our recent study identified alpha 1-antitrypsin as a potential biomarker of gastric cancer in gastric juice. The aim of this study was to develop a novel noninvasive modality for detecting gastric cancer by measurement of alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration in gastric juice. The work consisted of two parts: (a) investigating the differences in gastric juice alpha 1-antitrypsin concentrations between gastric cancer patients and controls, and (b) screening gastric cancer using string test to obtain gastric juice followed by immunoassay for alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration. The data showed that gastric juice alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration was markedly higher in gastric cancer patients than in healthy subjects, gastric ulcer patients, and duodenal ulcer patients (all P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for identifying gastric cancer cases was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.99; P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of gastric juice alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration were 96% and 92%, respectively. Gastric juice alpha 1-antitrypsin assay through string test was validated in 93 consecutive patients for gastric cancer screening. The sensitivity and specificity of gastric juice alpha 1-antitrypsin string test at 85% accuracy were 74% and 88%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for identifying gastric cancer was 0.84. In conclusion, gastric juice alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration in gastric cancer patients markedly exceeds those in healthy subjects and patients with benign gastrointestinal diseases.

However, quantitative evaluation of the image enhancement shown by NBI and FICE has not been reported. The aim of this study was to measure and compare the degrees of image enhancement in NBI and FICE. We compared the visibility of human blood diluted with distilled water between that shown by white-light imaging (WLI) and that shown by NBI or FICE. One milliliter of human blood was plated onto a 12-well transparent plastic plate to set up doubling dilutions, from 1/2 to 1/2(23). High-definition endoscopes were used for each imaging method. A total of 11 endoscopists independently evaluated the visibility of the diluted blood. The median dilution was defined as the limit of visibility in each image. NBI enabled clearer visualization of the presence of blood compared with conventional WLI. NBI recognized blood contamination up to a 1/2(14) dilution, whereas conventional WLI recognized blood contamination up to a 1/2(11) dilution. In contrast, FICE did not improve the visualization of diluted blood and recognized blood contamination up to a 1/2(10) dilution.

The primary factors influencing curative efficacy in GIC patients are drug inefficacy and high surgical and pharmacological therapy recurrence rates. Due to its unique optical features, good biocompatibility, surface effects, and small size effects, nanotechnology is a developing and advanced area of study for detecting and treating cancer. Considering the limitations of GIC MRI and endoscopy and the complexity of gastric surgery, the early diagnosis and prompt treatment of gastric illnesses by nanotechnology has been a promising development. Nanoparticles directly target tumor cells, allowing their detection and removal. It also can be engineered to carry specific payloads, such as drugs or contrast agents, and enhance the efficacy and precision of cancer treatment. In this research, the boosting technique of machine learning was utilized to capture nonlinear interactions between a large number of input variables and outputs by using XGBoost and RNN-CNN as a classification method. The research sample included 350 patients, comprising 200 males and 150 females. The patients' mean +/- SD was 50.34 +/- 13.04 with a mean age of 50.34 +/- 13.04.

Gene-gene interactions between protein-coding genes have been paid great attention, while rare studies refer to the interactions between encoding and noncoding genes. Our research group previously found encoding gene PGC polymorphisms could affect the susceptibility to atrophic gastritis (AG) and gastric cancer (GC). Interestingly, several SNPs in long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, just adjacent to PGC, were found to be associated with AG risk and GC prognosis afterward. This study aims to explore the SNP interactions between PGC and its neighbor lncRNAs on the risk of AG and GC. Genotyping for seven PGC SNPs and seven lncRNA SNPs was conducted using Sequenom MassARRAY platform in a total of 2228 northern Chinese subjects, including 536 GC cases, 810 AG cases, and 882 controls.

In the present study, we aimed to explore plasma miR-217 expression in GC patients and evaluated its diagnostic value as a promising biomarker for GC screening. The plasma samples were collected from 137 patients with GC and 145 healthy controls. Plasma miR-217 expression was determined through qRT-PCR and further correlated with patients' clinicopathological parameters and follow-up data. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was carried out to assess the diagnostic value of plasma miR-217 in GC, and COX regression analysis was performed to find independent risk factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of GC patients. Compared with healthy controls, expression of plasma miR-217 was remarkably lower in GC patients (P<0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of plasma miR-217 was 0.893, and its specificity and sensitivity were 0.832 and 0.813 at a diagnostic threshold of 0.021. Down-regulation of plasma miR-217 was closely associated with larger tumor size (P=0.040), present distant metastasis (P=0.038), poor differentiation status (P=0.016) and advanced TNM stage (P=0.005). GC patients with low plasma miR-217 expression had relatively lower overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) rate after surgery than those with high plasma miR-217 expression. Moreover, multivariate COX regression analysis demonstrated that plasma miR-217 expression was an independent risk factor for OS and DFS of GC patients.

However, the clinical significance of these microRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) remains to be clarified. In the current study, we investigated the potential utility of circulating miR-196a/b as novel biomarkers for early detection and/or metastatic prognosis of GC. The quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction data revealed markedly higher pre-operative circulating miR-196a and miR-196b levels in GC patients than healthy controls. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis showed that circulating miR-196a, miR-196b and combined miR-196a and miR-196b (miR-196a/b) are more effective than carcinoembryonic antigen or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 alone in distinguishing GC patients from healthy controls, with higher sensitivity and specificity. Circulating miR-196a exhibited higher diagnostic capacity than combined miR-196a/b or miR-196b alone, highlighting its potential as an effective plasma biomarker for GC. In clinicopathological analysis, elevated circulating miR-196a/b levels were highly correlated with metastatic potential or more advanced stages of disease and poorer survival. In addition, the expression levels of circulating miR-196a/b were reduced after surgical resection in GC patients. Taken together, we propose that circulating miR-196a/b serve as a more sensitive and specific novel biomarker than carbohydrate antigen 19-9 for GC monitor, diagnosis and prognosis.

Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize miR-128 in gastric cancer. We found first that miR-128 is down-regulated in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues, and this dysregulation is correlated with DNA methylation and the transcription factor SNAIL. Using prediction tools, western blotting, and luciferase reporter assays, we found that Bmi-1 was the direct target of miR-128. Additionally, overexpression of miR-128 inhibited gastric cancer cell migration, invasion, and proliferation by targeting Bmi-1 in vitro and in vivo. We also documented, with receiver operating characteristic curves and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, that miR-128 and Bmi-1 may be useful markers for diagnosing and estimating the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. As the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is an important mechanism associated with cancer invasion and metastasis, we inferred that miR-128 could regulate this mechanism in gastric cancer. In fact, we found that miR-128 could reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by Bmi-1 via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Because SNAIL also acts as a mesenchymal marker, our findings identified a novel positive feedback loop in which the transcription factor SNAIL curbs the expression of miR-128, and then down-regulated miR-128 promotes the expression of Bmi-1; finally, overexpression of Bmi-1 drives the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process via the PI3K/AKT pathway, and the expression of SNAIL is up-regulated.",2017/6/13,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:10,,39280-39295,,24,8,,Oncotarget,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 16 Place: Orchard Park Publisher: Impact Journals Llc Web of Science ID: WOS:000403311900102,,,,gastric cancer; BREAST-CANCER; OVEREXPRESSION; PROSTATE-CANCER; PROLIFERATION; DNA methylation; CELL LUNG-CANCER; SNAIL; BMI-1 ONCOPROTEIN; EPIGENETIC REGULATION; MICRORNA-128; miR-128; POLYCOMB-GROUP PROTEINS; transcription factor; 828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CtDNA can now be part of the clinical routine as a promising, highly sensitive and specific biomarker with a broad range of applicability. Liquid-biopsy based postoperative relapse prediction could lead to improved survival by intensification of adjuvant treatment in patients identified to be at risk of early recurrence. Moreover, ctDNA allows monitoring of antineoplastic treatment success, with identification of potentially developed resistance or therapeutic targets during the course of treatment. It may also assist in early change of chemotherapy in metastatic gastrointestinal malignancies prior to imaging findings of relapse.

In this study, we analyzed the role of KRAS status in MSI GC and the impact of MSI status on KRAS mutation. We performed analysis on 595 GC patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the screening of KRAS mutation (exon 2) and 5 quasi-monomorphic mononucleotide repeats, namely, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR -24, NR-21, and NR-27 were used to determine the MSI status. The KRAS and MSI status were then compared with clinicopathologic data of the GC patients. MSI GC was found in 20.3% of all cases. KRAS mutation was seen in 24 patients; 18 were MSI (75%) and 6 were microsatellite stable (MSS) (25%). MSI GC patients with KRAS mutation were older and mostly female, but MSS presented more advanced T and N stage of the disease, more cardia tumors, and adjuvant treatment. Five-year survival was 72.2% for KRAS mutation patients with MSI and 0% for MSS (p < 0.001). Although KRAS mutations in GC are linked with MSI in the majority of cases, KRAS mutations with MSS status presented with a poor prognosis and a worse outcome. In multivariate analysis, MSI was associated with better survival (p < 0.001) but KRAS was with worse survival (p = 0.304).

Conventional serological tests for screening gastric cancer have limits on sensitivity and specificity. Several miRNAs in peripheral blood have been used as biomarkers of gastric cancer. However, most of these miRNAs are shared by several types of cancer. Thanks to the tissue specificity of gastric juice, here we examined the feasibility of using gastric juice miR-129-1/2, which are aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer, to screen gastric cancer. Total of 141 gastric juices samples from gastric cancer, gastric ulcer, atrophic gastritis, and minimal gastritis patients or subjects with normal mucosa were collected by gastroscopy. The gastric juice miR-129-1/2 levels were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed for differentiating patients with gastric cancer from patients with benign gastric diseases. We showed that, compared with patients with benign gastric diseases, patients with gastric cancer had significantly lower levels of gastric juice miR-129-1-3p and miR-129-2-3p. The areas under ROC curve (AUC) were 0.639 and 0.651 for miR-129-1-3p and miR-129-2-3p, respectively. Using the parallel combination test, the AUC was up to 0.656. In summary, our results suggest that gastric juice miR-129-1-3p and miR-129-2-3p are potential biomarkers for the screening gastric cancer, and the detection of gastric juice miRNAs is a convenient non-invasion method for the diagnosis of gastric cancer.",Mar-13,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:17,,365,,1,30,,Med.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the feasibility of using gastric juice miRNAs as potential biomarkers to assist in screening for gastric cancer. METHODS: Gastric juice samples were collected from 141 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination between September 2010 and December 2011. Gastric cancer and adjacent normal biopsy specimens also were collected. The existence and stability of miRNAs in gastric juices were determined by real-time reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and sequencing. miRNA levels in tissues and gastric juices were detected by RT-qPCR. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed for differentiating gastric cancer from benign gastric diseases. RESULTS: Levels of miRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-106a in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher compared with the levels in adjacent tissues (P = .006 and P = .001, respectively). Patients who had gastric cancer had significantly different levels of gastric juice miR-21 and miR-106a compared with patients who had benign gastric diseases (both P < .001). There were significant correlations between miR-21/miR-106a levels and Borrmann types. miR-21 levels in intestinal type gastric cancer specimens were higher than that in diffuse (P = .003) or mixed (P < .001) gastric cancer types. The area under the ROC curve was up to 0.969 for miR-21 and 0.871 for miR-106a.

Previous studies revealed that miRNAs are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity. In this study, we measured the plasma expression levels of three miRNAs (miR-21, miR-27a, and miR-155) to investigate the usefulness of miRNAs for gastric cancer detection. We initially examined plasma miRNA expression levels in a screening cohort consisting of 15 patients with gastric cancer and 15 healthy controls from Korean population, using TaqMan quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed that the expression level of miR-27a was significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer than in healthy controls, whereas the miR-21 and miR-155a expression levels were not significantly higher in the patients with gastric cancer. Therefore, we further validated the miR-27a expression level in 73 paired gastric cancer tissues and in a validation plasma cohort from 35 patients with gastric cancer and 35 healthy controls. In both the gastric cancer tissues and the validation plasma cohort, the miR-27a expression levels were significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of the validation cohort, revealed an area under the ROC curve value of 0.70 with 75% sensitivity and 56% specificity in discriminating gastric cancer.

Recently, miRNAs have been detected in remarkably stable forms in many types of body fluids. A comparison between cancer patients and healthy individuals has clearly shown that certain types of circulating miRNAs are associated with cancer initiation and progression. Research on miRNA-based biomarkers has witnessed phenomenal growth, owing to the non-invasive nature of miRNA-based screening assays and their sensitivity and specificity in detecting cancers. Consequently, a considerable effort has been devoted to identify suitable miRNAs for cancer diagnosis and also decode the information carried by circulating miRNAs. This review highlights the current studies that focus on the identification of circulating miRNA-based diagnostic and prognostic markers, for the most prevalent types of cancer. Additionally, the review also provides an insight into the putative functions of miRNAs, and attempts to delineate the mechanisms through which they are released into the bloodstream. Moreover, methodologies and strategies for identification of circulating miRNAs in cancers are summarized. Finally, potential strategies for circulating miRNA-based cancer therapies are proposed.

Therefore, miRNAs are widely investigated for early detection of cancers which can lead to improved survival rates and quality of life. This is particularly important in the case of gastrointestinal cancers, where early detection of the disease could substantially impact patients' survival. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21 or miRNA-21) is one of the most frequently researched miRNAs, where it is involved in the pathophysiology of cancer and the downregulation of several tumor suppressor genes. In gastrointestinal cancers, miR-21 regulates phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (SMAD7), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), beta-catenin, tropomyosin 1, maspin, and ras homolog gene family member B (RHOB).

Imaging technology has been steadily evolving in the endoscopy field. Improvements in the resolution of standard endoscopy images used in screening and surveillance provide greater opportunities to find gastric cancer earlier. Image enhancement endoscopy (IEE), such as narrow band imaging (NBI), highlights mucosal structures and vascularity. In particular, when NBI is used with magnifying endoscopy, it reveals fine details of subtle superficial abnormalities of EGC that are difficult to recognize using standard white light endoscopy. IEE-assisted magnifying endoscopy has improved the accuracy of the differentiation of superficial gastric cancer as well as delineation of the diseased mucosa. The advanced imaging technology enables precise assessment of the risk of lymph node metastasis of EGC and is widely used to determine indications for endoscopic treatment. It is not an overstatement to say that this has become the basis for the current development and dissemination of endoscopic treatments. Moreover, the resolution of endoscopic imaging has been upgraded to the microscopy level by the development of endomicroscopy, including endocytoscopy and confocal laser endomicroscopy.

This study aimed to clarify its role in gastric CSCs and explore the mechanisms. We found that low-expression of Mel-18 was correlated with poor prognosis and negatively correlated with overexpression of stem cell markers Oct4, Sox2, and Gli1 in 101 gastric cancer tissues. Mel-18 was down-regulated in cultured spheroid cells, which possess CSCs, and overexpression of Mel-18 inhibits cells sphere-forming ability and tumor growth in vivo. Besides, Mel-18 was lower-expressed in ovary metastatic lesions compared with that in primary lesions of gastric cancer, and Mel-18 overexpression inhibited the migration ability of gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, overexpression of Mel-18 resulted in down-regulation of miR-21 in gastric cancer cells and the expression of Mel-18 was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-21 in gastric cancer tissues.

We previously showed that promoter methylation may gradually increase or decrease during the transition from gastric mucosa (GM) to intestinal metaplasia (IM) to gastric cancer (GC). In our study, we focused on regional CpG hypomethylation of the promoter-proximal DNA of the transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) in IM and GC cells. We validated the hypomethylation of promoter-proximal DNA of OC2 in 160 primary GCs, in which methylation level correlated negatively with OC2 mRNA level. IM and GC cells stained positively for OC2, whereas GM cells did not. Stable transfection of OC2 in GC cells promoted colony formation, cell migration, invasion and proliferation. Moreover, OC2 knockdown with a short hairpin RNA suppressed tumorigenesis in nude mice. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing and RNA-seq analyses revealed that OC2 triggered ACSL5, which is strongly expressed in IM of the stomach but not in GM, indicating that OC2 and ACSL5 are early-stage biomarkers for GC. We also observed a high correlation between the levels of OC2 and ACSL5 mRNAs in the GENT database These results suggest that epigenetic alteration of OC2 upregulates its expression, which then activates ACSL5; thus, OC2 is induced in IM by epigenetic alteration and triggers ACSL5 expression, and thus OC2 and ACSL5 may cooperatively promote intestinal differentiation and GC progression.",2020/6/15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:03,,3354-3368,,12,146,,Int.

For GC, the five-year survival rate is generally 5-25%, but for EGC, it is almost up to 90%. Among the cancers, GC is very deadly. It is difficult for doctors to assess its threat to patients as it requires years of medical practice and rigorous testing. The healthcare sector has benefitted from AI for the early diagnosis or classification of GC. However, the current AI-based techniques need further improvement in clinical testing. Heterogeneous GC characterization requires more optimized methods for early detection of GC because of its type and severity. Hence, it is essential to investigate this area further and develop more optimized approaches for early diagnosis. Early detection will increase the chances of successful treatments. In this study, we have conducted a literature survey detailing the role of AI in the healthcare sector for GC diagnosis. We discuss basic principles, advantages and disadvantages, training and testing of data, and integration of applications like DSS, CDSS, KDD, ML, DM, BD, and DL, and their relevance to the healthcare industry. The study focuses on the application of ML techniques used in the diagnosis of GC. This review paper also introduces DM techniques, their application in the healthcare industry, limitations, roles, and operational challenges. These assist pathologists in helping minimize their workload while increasing diagnostic accuracy. These techniques will further assist medical practitioners with their decision-making process.",Nov-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:57,,147-166,,7,45,,Informatica,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 20 Place: Ljubljana Publisher: Slovensko Drustvo Informatika Web of Science ID: WOS:000741056200001,,,,RISK; gastric cancer; PROGNOSIS; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; early gastric cancer; machine learning; deep learning; CLASSIFICATION; stomach cancer; artificial intelligence; OPPORTUNITIES; ALGORITHMS; BIG DATA ANALYTICS; BigData; clinical decision support system; data mining; decision support system; helicobacter pylori; knowledge discovery in database; 390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the diagnostic efficacy of white light imaging (WLI) and that of ME-NBI for early gastric cancer. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify studies which met the inclusion criteria. A random-effects model was used to calculate overall sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess the diagnostic efficacy of WLI and ME-NBI in early gastric cancer. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the stability of the results. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, and included 1724 patients and 2153 lesions. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for the diagnosis of early gastric cancer using WLI were 0.48 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.57; I (2) = 78.6 %], 0.67 (95 % CI 0.62-0.71; I (2) = 81.9 %), and 0.62, respectively.

The studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity. Further sensitivity analysis was mainly performed for the studies of small lesions (mean size 10 mm or less) and the studies with a the score of 12 points or greater in the literature quality assessment, and the AUCs for ME-NBI for diagnosis of early gastric cancer were between 0.93 and 0.98, which suggested that the diagnostic value was still high and stable.

LncRNA expression microarray data indicate that KRT19P3 (Keratin 19 Pseudogene 3) is downregulated in GC samples. However, the expression pattern and molecular mechanism of KRT19P3 in GC have not been characterized. The present study confirmed the downregulation of KRT19P3 in GC tissues and cells. Decreased expression of KRT19P3 was correlated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, Lauren's classification, positive lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Enforced expression of KRT19P3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Conversely, KRT19P3 knockdown had opposite effects. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assay revealed that KRT19P3 could directly bind COPS7A. KRT19P3 enhanced COPS7A protein stability in GC cells, and KRT19P3 suppressed GC cell proliferation and metastasis partly through regulation of COPS7A expression. COPS7A could promote deubiquitinylation of I kappa B alpha, which was executed by CSN-associated deubiquitinylase USP15, and then KRT19P3 inactivated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway in a COPS7A-dependent manner. For the first time, we revealed that KRT19P3 could suppress tumor growth and metastasis through COPS7A-mediated NF-kappa B pathway, which may serve as potential targets for treatment of GC in the future.",2019/11/7,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:04,,7073-7088,,45,38,,Oncogene,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 16 Place: London Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Web of Science ID: WOS:000495878400004,,,,EXPRESSION; BREAST-CANCER; COP9 SIGNALOSOME; DEGRADATION; HOMOLOG; P53; 640,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although up-regulation of lncRNA UCA1 (urothelial carcinoma-associated 1) in several cancers has been found, its role in gastric cancer remains elusive. The aim of this study was to detect the expression of lncRNA UCA1 in gastric cancer and its clinical association. The expression of UCA1 was detected in 112 pairs of tumorous and adjacent normal tissues from patients with gastric cancer, as well as in four gastric cancer cell lines and a human normal gastric epithelium cell line using RT-qPCR. Results showed that UCA1 expression was remarkably increased in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines compared with that in the normal control. Clinicopathologic analysis revealed that high UCA1 expression correlated with worse differentiation, tumor size, invasion depth and TNM stage in gastric cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that increased UCA1 expression contributed to poor overall survival (p = 0.017) and disease-free survival (p = 0.024) of patients. A multivariate survival analysis also indicated that UCA1 could be an independent prognostic marker. The levels of UCA1 in gastric juice from gastric patients were significantly higher than those from normal subjects (p = 0.016). Moreover, validation analysis showed that UCA1 levels were robust in differentiating gastric cancer patients from control subjects [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.721; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.655-0.788, p < 0.01].

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the China Academic Journals Full-text Database and the Chinese Scientific Journals Database were systematically searched for potential studies. Studies were included if they were associated with lncRNAs, gastric cancer and reported diagnostic outcomes. Analysis of diagnostic values was used to summarize the overall test performance of lncRNAs. Ten studies were included in this meta-analysis. The ranges of the diagnostic value of lncRNAs for gastric cancer were as follows: Sensitivity was 0.45-0.83, and pooled sensitivity was 0.63; specificity was 0.60-0.93, and pooled specificity was 0.75; positive likelihood ratio was 1.80-6.92, and pooled positive likelihood ratio was 2.51; negative likelihood ratio was 0.23-0.67, and pooled negative likelihood ratio was 0.50; diagnostic odds ratio was 3.33-13.75, and pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 5.47. An overall area under the curve value of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.7550. LncRNAs did not have a high accuracy for identifying gastric cancer at present, but may be a useful screening tool for diagnosing gastric cancer due to their correlation with gastric cancer biological features.

To identify novel lncRNA biomarkers for gastric cancer (GC), we conducted, for the first time, genome-wide lncRNA screening analysis in two sets of samples: five paired preoperative and postoperative day 14 plasma samples from GC patients, and tissue samples from tumor and adjacent normal tissues. Candidate tumor-related lncRNAs were then quantitated and evaluated in three independent phases comprising 321 participants. The expression levels of lncRNAs were also measured in GC cell lines and the corresponding culture medium. Biomarker panels, lncRNA-based Index I and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-based Index II, were constructed using logistic regression, and their diagnostic performance compared. Fagan's nomogram was plotted to facilitate clinical application. As a result, we identified five novel plasma lncRNAs (TINCR, CCAT2, AOC4P, BANCR and LINC00857), which, when combined in the lncRNA-based Index I, outperformed the CEA-based Index II (P < 0.001) and could distinguish GC patients from healthy controls with an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.95). The lncRNA-based index decreased significantly by postoperative day 14 (P = 0.016), indicating its ability to monitor tumor dynamics. High values of the lncRNA-based index were correlated with tumor size (P = 0.036), depth of invasion (P = 0.025), lymphatic metastasis (P = 0.012) and more advanced tumor stages (P = 0.003).

We also compared its levels in paired preoperative and postoperative plasma samples. In addition, we compared the levels of LINC00152 in plasma and in exosomes, which were extracted from the same plasma and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The levels of plasma LINC00152 were significantly elevated in gastric cancer patients compared with healthy controls. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma LINC00152 in the diagnosis of gastric cancer were 48.1 and 85.2 %, respectively. There were no significant differences of LINC00152 levels between gastric epithelial dysplasia patients and healthy controls. LINC00152 levels in preoperative plasma samples were lower than those in postoperative ones. There were also no differences between LINC00152 levels in plasma and in exosomes.

MEG3 is involved in many molecular mechanisms that inhibit the development and progression of gastric cancer. For example, MEG3 can inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of miR-21, miR-665, miR-148, miR-208, etc. MEG3 inhibits gastric carcinogenesis by inhibiting the negative regulator MDM2, regulating the expression of tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb gene, and managing PI3K/Akt and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways. Additionally, gastric cancer patients with low MEG3 expression have poor prognosis, and transfection of MEG3 can improve the overall survival time of normal cells.

The aim of this study was to examine whether ALD is associated with the increased risk of gastric neoplasia. We reviewed the medical records 514 patients diagnosed with ALD at Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Hospital between January 2000 and December 2011. Control subjects were selected by using propensity score matching (age, sex, and body mass index) from 8190 members of the general population who underwent EGD for screening for gastric neoplasia at Boramae Health Promotion Center during the study period. We compared the frequency of gastric neoplasia between the two groups and evaluated the risk factors for the development of gastric cancer in patients with ALD. In addition, we compared the frequency of gastric cancer between patients with ALD and those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Of the 514 patients with ALD, 16 patients (3.1 %) had gastric neoplasia, including 14 gastric cancers (2.7 %). The odds of detecting a gastric cancer in ALD patients were approximately 4.77 times greater than in healthy controls [odds ratio (OR) 4.77; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.36-16.69; P = 0.007].

This non-invasive, feasible, and easy-to-repeat method has been shown to be cost-effective and capable of increasing diagnostic sensitivity and prognostic assessment. Additionally, it is potentially accurate to aid decision-making and personalized treatment planning. MicroRNA (miRNA) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) markers can enhance GC management in various aspects, including diagnosis (mainly earlier diagnosis and the ability to perform population-based screening), prognosis (more precise stratification of prognosis), and treatment (including more accurate prediction of treatment response and earlier detection of resistance to the treatment). Concerning the treatment-related application, miRNAs' mimics and antagonists (by using two main strategies of restoring tumor suppressor miRNAs and inhibiting oncogene miRNAs) have been shown to be effective therapeutic agents. However, these need to be further validated in clinical trials. Furthermore, novel delivery systems, such as lipid-based vectors, polymeric-based vectors, and exosome-based delivery, have been developed to enhance the performance of these agents.

In this study we developed an effective and convenient blood-based test to detect gastric cancer. This test combined a conventional protein test with a newly invented methylation test. We aimed to validate the test and examine its performance using a prospective cohort study. The study showed that the test has promising potential for noninvasive early detection of gastric cancer. We found that single protein or methylation markers detected a proportion of gastric cancer cases, while a combination of these markers exhibited maximal detection capability. Therefore we concluded that the combined test provided adequate efficacy and should be used as a strategy for future gastric cancer detection. Aim: This study aimed to validate a combination of mSEPT9, mRNF180 and CA724 for gastric cancer (GC) detection. Patients & methods: The performance of mSEPT9, mRNF180 and CA724 was examined in a prospective cohort study with 518 participants (151 with GC, 56 with atrophic gastritis, 87 with other gastrointestinal diseases and 224 with no evidence of disease). Results: mSEPT9, mRNF180 or CA724 alone detected 48.3, 37.1 and 43.1% of GC, respectively. The combination of mSEPT9 and mRNF180 detected 60.3% of GC, and the combination of all three markers detected 68.6% of GC.

Consequently, early detection and diagnosis based on morphological changes to the microvessels are crucial. In the last few years, new imaging techniques which utilize the properties of light-tissue interaction have been developed to increase early diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) tract neoplasia. We analyzed several ""red-flag"" endoscopic techniques used to enhance visualization of the vascular pattern of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions (e.g. trimodal imaging including autofluorescence imaging, magnifying endoscopy and narrow band imaging). These new endoscopic techniques provide better visualization of mucosal microsurface structure and microvascular architecture and may enhance the diagnosis and characterization of mucosal lesions in the GI tract. In the near future, it is expected that trimodal imaging endoscopy will be practiced as a standard endoscopy technique as it is quick, safe and accurate for making a precise diagnosis of gastrointestinal pathology, with an emphasis on the diagnosis of early GI tract cancers. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials comparing these modalities in different patient subpopulations are warranted before their endorsement in the routine practice of GI endoscopy.

This study aims to investigate the expression and function of ACBD3 in human gastric cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were selected to analyze mRNA levels of ACBD3 in gastric cancer tissues and normal gastric epithelial tissues. qPCR and Western blot were conducted to detect the expression of ACBD3 in two normal gastric epithelial cell lines and five gastric cancer cell lines which were cultured in our laboratory. To exclude differences in individual background between different patients, we further detected the expression of ACBD3 in 8 pairs of malignant/non-malignant clinical gastric tissues. Through the establishment of stable cells, in vitro cell experiments and in vivo xenotransplantation models in mice, the role of ACBD3 in the proliferation of gastric cancer cells has been further explored. AKT inhibitors were used to deeply explore the molecular regulation mechanism of ACBD3. The results showed that the elevated ACBD3 in gastric cancer tissue were positively correlated with the clinical grade and prognosis of gastric cancer. In terms of molecular function, we found that ACBD3 can enhance the production and growth of gastric cancer cells. At the same time, the activation of AKT kinase played an important role in ACBD3's promotion of G1-to-S transition.

Risk of bias, hazard ratios (HRs), and risk differences (RD) were assessed. Forty-five studies containing 3,342 GC patients from nine countries were assessed. The overall prevalence of CTC in GC was 69.37% (60.27, 77.78). The pooled result showed that increased mortality in GC patients was significantly associated with positive CTCs, poor overall survival (HR = 2.73, 95%CI 2.34-3.24, p < 0.001), and progression-free survival rate (HR = 2.78, 95%CI 2.01-3.85, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses regarding markers, detection methods, treatment type, presence of distance metastasis, presence of lymph node metastasis, and overall risk of bias showed significant associations between the groups in terms of the incidence rates of CTCs, OS, and PFS. In addition, the results of risk differences based on sampling time showed that the use of the cell search method (RD: - 0.19, 95%CI (- 0.28, - 0.10), p < 0.001), epithelial marker (RD: - 0.12, 95%CI (- 0.25, 0.00), p 0.05) and mesenchymal markers (RD: - 0.35, 95%CI (- 0.57, - 0.13), p 0.002) before the treatment might have a higher diagnostic power to identify CTCs and also chemotherapy treatment (RD: - 0.17, 95%CI (- 0.31, - 0.03), p 0.016) could significantly reduce the number of CTCs after the treatment. We also found that the risk differences between the clinical early and advanced stages were not statistically significant (RD: - 0.10, 95%CI (- 0.23, 0.02), P 0.105). Also, in the Lauren classification, the incidence of CTC in the diffuse type (RD: - 0.19, 95%CI (- 0.37, - 0.01), P0.045) was higher than that in the intestinal type. Meta-regression analysis showed that baseline characteristics were not associated with the detection of CTCs in GC patients.

We assessed the performance of two pepsinogen assays with or without gastrin-17 for the detection of different precancerous lesions alone or as a composite endpoint in a Latvian cohort. Methods-Within the intervention arm of the GISTAR population-based study, participants with abnormal pepsinogen values by ELISA or latex-agglutination tests, or abnormal gastrin-17 by ELISA and a subset of subjects with all normal biomarker values were referred for upper endoscopy with biopsies. Performance of biomarkers, corrected by verification bias, to detect five composite outcomes based on atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or cancer was explored. Results-Data from 1045 subjects were analysed, of those 273 with normal biomarker results. Both pepsinogen assays showed high specificity (>93%) but poor sensitivity (range: 18.4-31.1%) that slightly improved when lesions were restricted to corpus location (40.5%) but decreased when dysplasia and prevalent cancer cases were included (23.8%). Adding gastrin-17 detection, sensitivity reached 33-45% while specificity decreased (range: 61.1-62%) and referral rate for upper endoscopy increased to 38.6%.

The latest endoscopic system, EVIS X1, includes third-generation narrow-band imaging (3G-NBI), texture and color enhancement imaging (TXI), and high-definition white-light imaging (WLI). Therefore, this randomized phase II trial aimed to identify the most promising imaging modality for GN detection using 3G-NBI and TXI. METHODS:Patients with scheduled surveillance endoscopy after a history of esophageal cancer or GN or preoperative endoscopy for known esophageal cancer or GN were randomly assigned to the 3G-NBI, TXI, or WLI groups. Endoscopic observations were performed to detect new GN lesions, and all suspected lesions were biopsied. The primary endpoint was the GN detection rate during primary observation. Secondary endpoints were the rate of missed GNs, early gastric cancer detection rate, and positive predictive value for a GN diagnosis. The decision rule had a higher GN detection rate between 3G-NBI and TXI, outperforming WLI by >1.0%. RESULTS:Finally, 901 patients were enrolled and assigned to the 3G-NBI, TXI, and WLI groups (300, 300, and 301 patients, respectively). GN detection rates in the 3G-NBI, TXI, and WLI groups were 7.3, 5.0, and 5.6%, respectively. The rates of missed GNs were 1.0, 0.7, and 1.0%, the detection rates of early gastric cancer were 5.7, 4.0, and 5.6%, and the positive predictive values for the diagnosis of GN were 36.5, 21.3, and 36.8% in the 3G-NBI, TXI, and WLI groups, respectively.

Methods: We analyzed 8,191 patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancers at 33 hospitals in Japan from November 2013 to October 2016. Background factors were compared between single-lesion (n = 7,221) and synchronous multi-lesion cases (n = 970) using univariate and multivariate analyses. We extracted cases with two synchronous lesions (n = 832) and evaluated their localization. Results: Significant independent risk factors for synchronous multiple early gastric cancer were older age (>= 75 years old) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.257), male sex (OR = 1.385), severe mucosal atrophy (OR = 1.400), tumor localization in the middle (OR = 1.362) or lower region (OR = 1.404), and submucosal invasion (OR = 1.528 [SM1], 1.488 [SM2]). Depressed macroscopic type (OR = 0.679) and pure undifferentiated histology OR = 0.334) were more common in single early gastric cancers. When one lesion was in the upper region, the other was more frequently located in the lesser curvature of the middle region. When one lesion was in the middle region, the other was more frequently located in the middle region or the lesser curvature of the lower region. When one lesion was in the lower region, the other was more frequently located in the lesser curvature of the middle region or the lower region. Conclusion: Factors associated with synchronous multiple early gastric cancer included older age, male sex, severe mucosal atrophy, tumor localization in the middle or lower region, and tumor submucosal invasion.

The selected parameters comprise a system of molecular markers that can be used in both diagnostics of gastric cancer and in dynamic monitoring of patients after surgery. Special attention was paid to the use of molecular markers for the diagnostics of malignant process in the material obtained endoscopically since the efficacy of morphological diagnostics in biopsies is compromised by intratumoral heterogeneity, which may prevent reliable identification of tumor cells in the sampling. Our data indicated that certain molecular genetic events provided more sensitive yet specific markers of the tumor.

Methods: This collaborative work was realized under the auspices of several French medical societies involved in management of gastric cancer. Recommendations are graded in three categories (A-C), according to the amount of evidence found in the literature until July 2017. Results: There are several known risk factors for gastric cancer, including Helicobacter pylori and genetic predispositions, both requiring a specific screening for patients and their relatives. The diagnosis and staging evaluation are essentially based on gastroscopy plus biopsies and computed tomography scan. The endoscopic ultrasonography can be used for superficial tumors in case of discussion for endoscopic resection (T1N0). For local disease (N+ and/or T > T1), the strategic therapy is based on surgery associated with perioperative chemotherapy. In the absence of preoperative treatment (for any raison), the postoperative chemoradiotherapy (or chemotherapy) should be discussed for patients with stage II or III tumor. For metastatic disease, the treatment is based on ""palliative"" chemotherapy consisting in a doublet or triplet regimens depending of age, performance status and HER2 tumor status. For patients with limited metastatic disease, surgical resection could be discussed in multidisciplinary meeting in case of stable disease after chemotherapy. Conclusion: These guidelines in gastric cancer are done to help decision for daily clinical practice. These recommendations are permanently being reviewed. Each individual case must be discussed within a multidisciplinary team. (c) 2018 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Aim: To determine the prevalence of alarm symptoms, readiness levels to undergo endoscopic screening for cancer and to identify decision-making factors. Material and methods: Demographic and anthropometric data, alarm symptoms, nutritional habits, alcohol use, smoking, concomitant diseases and a family history of cancer were studied in an interview in a random sample from a middle-sized city. Results: A total of 850 people were interviewed between 2002 and 2009. Alarm symptoms (weight loss > 10 kg, abdominal pain waking the patient up at night, persistent vomiting, dysphagia, blood in stool, constipation < 12 months, diarrhea > 1 month, anemia) were present in 15% of participants. Fifty-two percent of those with alarm symptoms had not been diagnosed before the survey, 38% had never had and still refused diagnostic endoscopic procedures. Less than 20% of all respondents declared their willingness to be screened. Readiness was significantly higher in males, diabetics, respondents with previous endoscopy and those with a family history of neoplasm, and it increased with the level of education. Smokers more often refused screening procedures. There was no significant increase in readiness for screening over the period studied.

Methods: Data from patients with eradicated HP infection were extracted from the endoscopy databases of two institutions from January 2016 to March 2021. The patients were divided into a close follow-up group with frequent surveillance after eradication and an open follow-up group with an intermittent surveillance method, and the cases of post-eradication EGC found in the two groups were analyzed. Results: Thirty-six out of 9,322 patients (0.39%) in the close follow-up group and 20 out of 11,436 patients (0.17%) in the open follow-up group were found to have EGC. The cumulative incidence of EGC after eradication was significantly higher in the close follow-up group (p = 0.004). The duration between eradication and EGC detection was significantly shorter in the close follow-up group (51.7 vs. 90.5 months, p = 0.002). A logistic regression model revealed that duration after eradication was an independent predictor for detecting EGC in the close follow-up group (p = 0.045). A Cox proportional hazards model revealed that the close follow-up strategy was effective in patients with an eradication duration of less than 65 months to identify EGC (p = 0.015), but there was no difference between the two strategies in patients with an eradication duration of more than 65 months (p = 0.624).

The objective of this study was to provide real-world data on the impact of COVID-19 on endoscopic procedures in a safety-net healthcare system and cancer center affiliated with a tertiary academic center. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a combination of electronic health record data and a prospective data tool created to track endoscopy procedures throughout COVID-19 to describe patient and procedural characteristics of endoscopic procedures delayed during the initial COVID-19 surge. RESULTS: Of the 480 patients identified, the median age was 57 years (interquartile range 46-66), 55% (n = 262) were male, and 59% self-identified as white. Colonoscopy was the most common type of delayed procedure (49%), followed by combined esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy (22%), and EGD alone (20%). Colorectal cancer screening was the most common indication for delayed colonoscopy (35%), and evaluation of suspected bleeding (30%) was the most common indication for delayed combined EGD and colonoscopy. To date, 46% (223/480) of delayed cases have been completed with 12 colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers diagnosed. Sociodemographic factors, procedure type, and sedation type were not significantly associated with endoscopy completion. The median time to endoscopy after delayed procedure was 88 days (interquartile range 63-119) with no differences by procedure type.

Diagnostic models commonly included biomarkers, such as Helicobacter pylori infection indicator, pepsinogen, hormone, and microRNA. Age, sex, smoking, body mass index, and family history of gastric cancer were frequently used in prognostic models. Most of the models were not validated. Only 25% of models evaluated the calibration. All studies had a high risk of bias, but over half had acceptable applicability.

Although aberrant DNA methylation is deeply involved in gastric carcinogenesis, its induction by Helicobacter pylori, a strong gastric carcinogen, is unclear, Here, we analyzed the effect of H pylori infection on the quantity of methylated DNA molecules in noncancerous gastric mucosae and examined its association with gastric cancer risk. Experimental Design: Gastric mucosae were collected from 154 healthy volunteers (56 H. pylori negative and 98 H pylori positive) and 72 cases with differentiated-type gastric cancers (29 H. pylori negative and 43 H. pylori positive) by endoscopy. The numbers of DNA molecules methylated and unmethylated for eight regions of seven CpG islands (CGI) were quantified by quantitative PCR after bisulfite modification, and fractions of methylated molecules (methylation levels) were calculated. Results: Among healthy volunteers, methylation levels of all the eight regions were 5.4- to 303-fold higher in H. pylori positives than in H. pylori negatives (P < 0.0001). Methylation levels of the LOX, HAND1, and THBD promoter CGIs and p41ARC exonic CGI were as high as 7.4% or more in H. pylori - positive individuals. Among H pylori - negative individuals, methylation levels of all the eight regions were 2.2- to 32-fold higher in gastric cancer cases than in age-matched healthy volunteers (P <= 0.01). Among H. pylori - positive individuals, methylation levels were highly variable, and that of only HAND1 was significantly increased in gastric cancer cases (1.4-fold, P = 0.02). Conclusions: It was indicated that H. pylori infection potently induces methylation of CGIs to various degrees.

Idylla MSI assay has not been validated for GC but may prove to be a valid alternative.Methods: In a series of 140 GC cases, MSI status was evaluated by IHC for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6; gold-standard pentaplex PCR panel (PPP) (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, and NR-27); and Idylla. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 27.0.Results: PPP identified 102 microsatellite stable (MSS) cases and 38 MSI-high cases. Only three cases showed discordant results. Compared with PPP, the sensitivity was 100% for IHC and 94.7% for Idylla. Specificity was 99% for IHC and 100% for Idylla. MLH1 IHC alone showed sensitivity and specificity of 97.4% and 98.0%, respectively. IHC identified three indeterminate cases; all were MSS according to PPP and Idylla.Conclusion: IHC for MMR proteins represents an optimal screening tool for MSI status in GC. If resources are limited, isolated MLH1 evaluation may constitute a valuable option for preliminary screening. Idylla may help detect rare MSS cases with MMR-loss and define MSI status in indeterminate cases.",Dec-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,389-399,,6,90,,Pathobiology,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 11 Place: Basel Publisher: Karger Web of Science ID: WOS:001010213400001,,,,DIAGNOSIS; IDYLLA MSI TEST; 208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E-Cadherin protein is necessary for physiological signaling pathways, such as cell proliferation, maintenance of cell adhesion, cell polarity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Dysregulation leads to tumor proliferation, invasion, migration and metastases. We review current perspectives in CDH1 genetics with molecular mechanisms and also discuss management strategies for this aggressive form of gastric cancer. Methods: Relevant articles from PubMed/Medline and Embase (1994-2019) were searched and collected using the phrases ""Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Familial gastric cancer, CDH1 mutation, E-Cadherin, Lobular breast cancer, Prophylactic total gastrectomy"". Results: Current guidelines suggest maintaining a high degree of suspicion of hereditary etiology and recommend testing for CDH1 mutations in patients with familial clustering of HDGC and LBC, especially onset at an early age (before 40 years). In families lacking CDH1 mutations but with high suspicion for hereditary predisposition, testing of CTNNA1 and other closely related HDGC susceptibility genes could be considered. Prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended for individuals with identified pathogenic germline variants. Endoscopic surveillance with biopsies is recommended for those choosing to delay prophylactic gastrectomy. Conclusion: Mutation or transcriptional silencing of the CDH1 gene is associated with familial diffuse gastric cancer. Further studies on the expression and the alteration in the proteins in the E-cadherin pathways may serve as biomarkers for early detection; stratify risk and selection of appropriate therapy in these families. Until then prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended for individuals with CDH1 mutations and family history of diffuse gastric cancer. Endoscopic surveillance and biopsies by experienced gastroenterologists is recommended for those choosing not to have prophylactic gastrectomy and in individuals with CDH1 variants.",2019,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,10477-10486,,,11,,Cancer Manag.

To ensure the endoscopy quality, we constructed an endoscopic audit and feedback system named Endo.Adm and evaluated its effect in a form of pretest and posttest trial. METHODS: Endo.Adm system was developed using Python and Deep Convolutional Neural Ne2rk models. Sixteen endoscopists were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and were randomly assigned to undergo feedback of Endo.Adm or not (8 for the feedback group and 8 for the control group). The feedback group received weekly quality report cards which were automatically generated by Endo.Adm. We then compared the adenoma detection rate (ADR) and gastric precancerous conditions detection rate between baseline and postintervention phase for endoscopists in each group to evaluate the impact of Endo.Adm feedback. In total, 1,191 colonoscopies and 3,515 gastroscopies were included for analysis. RESULTS: ADR was increased after Endo.Adm feedback (10.8%-20.3%, P < 0.01, <odds ratio (OR) 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.317-3.447), and endoscopists' ADR without feedback remained nearly unchanged (10.8%-10.9%, P = 0.57, OR 1.086, 95% CI 0.814-1.447). Gastric precancerous conditions detection rate increased in the feedback group (3%-7%, P < 0.01, OR 1.866, 95% CI 1.399-2.489) while no improvement was observed in the control group (3.9%-3.5%, P = 0.489, OR 0.856, 95% CI 0.550-1.332). DISCUSSION: Endo.Adm feedback contributed to multifaceted gastrointestinal endoscopic quality improvement.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the main gastric carcinogen, and its treatment reduces GC incidence and mortality. Esophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) allows for the detection of premalignant conditions and early-stage GC. Mass screening programs for H. pylori infection and screening for premalignant conditions and early-stage GC are not currently implemented in LAC. The aim of this study is to establish recommendations for primary and secondary prevention of GC in asymptomatic standard-risk populations in Chile. Methods: Two on-line synchronous workshops and a seminar were conducted with Chilean experts. A Delphi panel consensus was conducted over 2 rounds to achieve >80% agreement on proposed primary and secondary prevention strategies for the population stratified by age groups. Results: 10, 12, and 12 experts participated in two workshops and a seminar, respectively. In the Delphi panel, 25 out of 37 experts (77.14%) and 28 out of 52 experts (53.85%) responded. For the population aged 16-34, there was no consensus on non-invasive testing and treatment for H. pylori, and the use of EGD was excluded. For the 35-44 age group, non-invasive testing and treatment for H. pylori is recommended, followed by subsequent test-of-cure using non-invasive tests (stool antigen test or urea breath test). In the >45 age group, a combined strategy is recommended, involving H. pylori testing and treatment plus non-invasive biomarkers (H. pylori IgG serology and serum pepsinogens I and II); subsequently, a selected group of subjects will undergo EGD with gastric biopsies (Sydney Protocol), which will be used to stratify surveillance according to the classification Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA); every 3 years for OLGA III-IV and every 5 years for OLGA I-II. Conclusion: A ""test-and-treat"" strategy for H. pylori infection based on non-invasive studies (primary prevention) is proposed in the 35-44 age group, and a combined strategy (serology and EGD) is recommended for the >45 age group (primary and secondary prevention).

Aberrant glycosylation in serum proteins has been associated with many human diseases. Serum haptoglobin, a highly sialylated glycoprotein with four N-glycosylation sites, has gained considerable attention due to its potential as a signature molecule to display aberrant glycosylation in inflammatory disorders and various types of cancer. In particular, the relevance of haptoglobin glycosylation in GC has been investigated in a multifaceted way. Areas covered: The screening of haptoglobin glycosylation could offer an alternative approach toward GC diagnosis and detection. In this report, various assay platforms such as glycan profiling, site-specific glycopeptide profiling, and intact protein profiling are introduced for the detection of abnormal glycosylation of serum haptoglobin. Expert opinion: Although aberrant glycosylation of serum haptoglobin is associated with gastric cancer patients and might be a promising marker of GC screening, the development of a diagnosis platform to increase specificity and sensitivity for clinical use is still an analytical challenge. However, the continuous advancement of analytical technologies and methods will spur the paradigm shift from traditional serum markers, enabling the effective mining of human glycoproteome for GC diagnostic markers.",2020/2/1,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:03,,109-117,,2,17,,Expert Rev.

In this study, we developed a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to detect GC with white light imaging (WLI) and linked color imaging (LCI) modes and aimed to compare the performance of CADe with that of endoscopists. Methods: The system was developed based on the deep learning framework from 9,021 images in 385 patients between 2017 and 2020. A total of 116 LCI and WLI videos from 110 patients between 2017 and 2023 were used to evaluate percase sensitivity and per-frame specificity. Results: The percase sensitivity and per-frame specificity of CADe with a confidence level of 0.5 in detecting GC were 78.6% and 93.4% for WLI and 94.0% and 93.3% for LCI, respectively (p < 0.001). The per-case sensitivities of nonexpert endoscopists for WLI and LCI were 45.8% and 80.4%, whereas those of expert endoscopists were 66.7% and 90.6%, respectively. Regarding detectability between CADe and endoscopists, the per-case sensitivities for WLI and LCI were 78.6% and 94.0% in CADe, respectively, which were significantly higher than those for LCI in experts (90.6%, p = 0.004) and those for WLI and LCI in nonexperts (45.8% and 80.4%, respectively, p < 0.001); however, no significant difference for WLI was observed between CADe and experts (p = 0.134).

We performed this study to address this issue. Methods: We collected serum samples from 319 participants comprising 225 healthy subjects without GC (control group) and 94 patients with early GC (early GC group). After evaluating copy numbers of serum hTERT and methylated RUNX3 (m-RUNX3) using the Combined Restriction Digital PCR (CORD) assay, which we developed, we assessed the diagnostic performance of hTERT and m-RUNX3 for early GC. Results: Serum levels of hTERT and m-RUNX3 were significantly higher in the early GC group than in the control group. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.89 for hTERT and 0.78 for m-RUNX3. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed age, sex, hTERT copy number, and m-RUNX3 copy number to be independent factors for early GC. We then established a prediction formula and named it the ASTEm-R3 (age, sex, hTERT, and m-RUNX3) index. The AUC of the ASTEm-R3 index was 0.93 with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 91.1%. Conclusion: We demonstrated excellent performance of the ASTEm-R3 index using the CORD assay to detect early GC.

Metabolic deregulation plays an important role in GC. Although various metabolite-level biomarkers for early detection have been assessed, there is still no unified early detection method. We conducted a plasma metabolome study to assess metabolites that may distinguish GC samples from non-GC samples. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 72 GC patients and 29 control participants (non-GC group) at the Tokyo Medical University Hospital between March 2020 and November 2020. Hydrophilic metabolites were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Differences in metabolite concentrations between the GC and non-GC groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test. The discrimination ability of each metabolite was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) model was developed to assess the discrimination ability of multiple metabolites. The selection of variables used for the SVM utilized a step-wise regression method. Results: Of the 96 quantified metabolites, 8 were significantly different between the GC and non-GC groups. Of these, N-1-acetylspermine, succinate, and histidine were used in the RBF-SVM model to discriminate GC samples from non-GC samples. The area under the curve (AUC) of the RBF-SVM model was higher (0.915; 95% CI: 0.865-0.965, p < 0.0001), indicating good performance of the RBF-SVM model. The application of this RBF-SVM to the validation dataset resulted from the AUC of the RBF-SVM model was (0.885; 95% CI: 0.797-0.973, p < 0.0001), indicating the good performance of the RBF-SVM model. The sensitivity of the RBF-SVM model was better (69.0%) than those of the common tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (10.5%) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (2.86%). The RBF-SVM showed a low correlation with CEA and CA19-9, indicating its independence. Conclusion: We analyzed plasma metabolomics, and a combination of the quantified metabolites showed high sensitivity for the detection of GC. The independence of the RBF-SVM from tumor markers suggested that their complementary use would be helpful for GC screening.",Mar-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:55,,97-108,,2,104,,Digestion,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 12 Place: Basel Publisher: Karger Web of Science ID: WOS:000889248300001,,,,BIOMARKERS; Gastric cancer; SERUM; Plasma; Metabolomics; Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; 278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: This study compared the diagnostic efficacy between magnifying blue light imaging with an LED light source (LED-BLI) and magnifying blue laser imaging with a laser light source (Laser-BLI) for early gastric cancer (EGC). Methods: In this prospective, single-center, noninferiority study, 80 gastric lesions were evaluated between January 2017 and July 2017. The magnifying findings of gastric lesions - including the demarcation line (DL), microvascular pattern (MVP), and microsurface pattern (MSP) - were evaluated using Laser-BLI and LED-BLI according to the vessel plus surface classification system (VSCS). The primary end point was to determine whether the diagnostic accuracy of LED-BLI for EGC was noninferior to that of conventional Laser-BLI. Results: Overall, we evaluated 79 gastric lesions histopathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinomas from the specimens obtained via endoscopic submucosal dissection. A DL was observed by Laser-BLI and LED-BLI in 98.7% (78/79) and 96.2% (76/79) of EGCs, respectively. The MVP observed using Laser-BLI and LED-BLI was irregular in 92.4% (73/79) and 89.9% (71/79), respectively. The MSP observed using Laser-BLI and LED-BLI was irregular in 83.5% (66/79) and 82.2% (65/79), respectively. According to the VSCS, diagnosable cancers were found in 94.9% (75/79) and 93.7% (74/79) of cases when using Laser-BLI and LED-BLI, respectively (p = 0.73; difference ratio, 1.2%; 95% CI -8.5 to 6.0%). Conclusions: LED-BLI could accurately visualize the DL, MVP, and MSP of EGCs and was not inferior to Laser-BLI.

The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of endoscopy to detect curable upper gastrointestinal malignancy in patients older than 55 years presenting with uncomplicated dyspepsia. Methods. A cohort study was performed in North Glasgow Health Trust. One hundred and thirty-one patients older than 55 years of age, diagnosed to have upper gastrointestinal cancer within the North Glasgow Trust between January 1995 and December 1997, identified by the West of Scotland Cancer Registry were included. The main outcome measures were the proportion of upper gastrointestinal cancers that present in patients older than 55 years with uncomplicated dyspepsia, and the proportion of patients that presented with uncomplicated dyspepsia who have curable upper gastrointestinal cancer. Results. Of the 131 cancer cases identified, only 30 (23%) had dyspepsia (complicated or uncomplicated) as their predominant symptom and only eight (6%) patients presented with uncomplicated dyspepsia. Of those eight patients presenting with uncomplicated dyspepsia and found to have upper gastrointestinal cancer, six were found to have lymph node metastases and/or extensive metastases at the time of diagnosis. Each of these six patients died from their cancer within 39 months of diagnosis. Of the two patients presenting with uncomplicated dyspepsia without evidence of lymph node spread, one died 55 days after diagnosis. Only one patient presenting with uncomplicated dyspepsia and found to have cancer remains alive at 5-year follow-up. Conclusions. Of the 131 patients diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal cancer, only eight presented with uncomplicated dyspepsia and only one of these was cured. Consequently a policy of endoscoping patients older than 55 years with uncomplicated dyspepsia will reduce death from upper gastrointestinal cancers by less than 1% in our population.",Jun-06,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:20,,645-648,,6,18,,Eur.

Objective We aimed to discover predictive serum biomarkers for GC and investigate biomarker-related metabolism. Methods Subjects were randomly selected from the Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II cohort and matched by age and sex. We analyzed baseline serum samples of 160 subjects (discovery set; control and GC occurrence group, 80 each) via nontargeted screening. Identified putative biomarkers were validated in baseline serum samples of 140 subjects (validation set; control and GC occurrence group, 70 each) using targeted metabolites analysis. Results The final analysis was conducted on the discovery set (control, n = 52 vs. GC occurrence, n = 50) and the validation set (control, n = 43 vs. GC occurrence, n = 44) applying exclusion conditions. Eighteen putative metabolite sets differed between two groups found on nontargeted metabolic screening. We focused on fatty acid-related energy metabolism.

The present study used bioinformatics to identify prognostic markers for gastric cancer that would guide the clinical diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Materials and Methods Gene expression data and clinical information of gastric cancer patients along with the gene expression data of 30 healthy samples were downloaded from the TCGA database. The initial screening was performed using the WGCNA method combined with the analysis of differentially expressed genes, which was followed by univariate analysis, multivariate COX regression analysis, and Lasso regression analysis for screening the candidate genes and constructing a prognostic model for gastric cancer. Subsequently, immune cell typing was performed using CIBERSORT to analyze the expression of immune cells in each sample. Finally, we performed laboratory validation of the results of our analyses using immunohistochemical analysis. Results After five screenings, it was revealed that only three genes fulfilled all the screening requirements. The survival curves generated by the prognostic model revealed that the survival rate of the patients in the high-risk group was significantly lower compared to the patients in the low-risk group (P-value < 0.001). The immune cell component analysis revealed that the three genes were differentially associated with the corresponding immune cells (P-value < 0.05).

Substantial investment has been made to develop biomarkers for cancer detection, but few have reached routine clinical practice. We aimed to identify novel biomarkers for upper GI cancers which have been sufficiently validated to be ready for evaluation in low-prevalence populations. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, and Web of Science for studies published in English from January 2000 to October 2019 (PROSPERO registration CRD42020165005). Reference lists of included studies were assessed. Studies had to report on second measures of diagnostic performance (beyond discovery phase) for biomarkers (single or in panels) used to detect pancreatic, oesophageal, gastric, and biliary tract cancers. We included all designs and excluded studies with less than 50 cases/controls. Data were extracted on types of biomarkers, populations and outcomes. Heterogeneity prevented pooling of outcomes. Results We identified 149 eligible studies, involving 22,264 cancer cases and 49,474 controls. A total of 431 biomarkers were identified (183 microRNAs and other RNAs, 79 autoantibodies and other immunological markers, 119 other proteins, 36 metabolic markers, 6 circulating tumour DNA and 8 other). Over half (n = 231) were reported in pancreatic cancer studies. Only 35 biomarkers had been investigated in at least two studies, with reported outcomes for that individual marker for the same tumour type. Apolipoproteins (apoAII-AT and apoAII-ATQ), and pepsinogens (PGI and PGII) were the most promising biomarkers for pancreatic and gastric cancer, respectively. Conclusion Most novel biomarkers for the early detection of upper GI cancers are still at an early stage of matureness.

This study aims to assess the capability of Raman spectroscopy for multi-class elucidation of intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis sequence in vivo for improving precancer detection at endoscopy. We employ a novel image-guided Raman endoscopy technique developed for in vivo gastric tissue Raman measurement within 0.5 s during clinical endoscopic examination. We have acquired a total of 1277 in vivo Raman spectra from 83 gastric patients associated with intestinal-type carcinogenesis. In vivo Raman spectroscopy integrated with semi-quantitative spectral modelling (e.g. DNA, lipids, glycoprotein, proteins and blood) reveals the progressive changes of biochemical constituents in gastric tissue associated with preneoplastic and neoplastic transformation (i.e., IM, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma). Multi-class probabilistic partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) diagnostic algorithms based on in vivo Raman spectra are able to identify normal mucosa with sensitivity of 75.88% and specificity of 87.21%; IM with sensitivity of 46.67% and specificity of 87.55%; dysplasia with sensitivity of 83.33%; specificity of 95.80%, and adenocarcinoma with sensitivity of 84.91% and specificity 95.57%, respectively.

As serum pepsinogen (PG) test-positive subjects with progression of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) show a high likelihood of future cancer development, this population warrants careful follow-up observation as a high-risk GC group. By combining the PG test with Helicobacter pylori (HP) antibody titers, the HP-related chronic gastritis stage can be classified, thus identifying not only a GC high-risk group but also a low-risk group. Among PG test-negative patients without CAG, those with high serum PG II levels and HP antibody titers are thought to have severe gastric mucosal inflammation and the risk of diffuse-type GC is also high. Meanwhile, in gastric mucosae obtained by endoscopic biopsy, HP infection induces aberrant DNA methylation in CpG islands in multiple gene regions and the extent of methylation clearly correlates with GC risk. By quantifying aberrant DNA methylation in suitable gene markers, we can determine the extent of the epigenetic field for cancerization. These novel concepts and risk markers will have many clinical applications in gastrointestinal endoscopy, including more efficient endoscopic GC screening and a strategic approach to metachronous multiple GCs after endoscopic treatment.",2010,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:13,,,,12,2,,World J.

Proposed screening protocols are not widely accepted and are based on gastric cancer risk factors that are not applicable to all CVID patients. Fifty-two CVID patients were recruited for screening gastroscopy irrespective of symptoms or blood results and were compared to 40 controls presenting for gastroscopy for other clinical indications. Overall, 34% of CVID patients had intestinal metaplasia (IM), atrophic gastritis or moderate to severe non-atrophic gastritis, which can increase the risk of gastric cancer, compared to 7.5% of controls (p<0.01). Focal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, a precursor lesion for gastrointestinal lymphoma, was seen in eight CVID patients (16%), one of whom was diagnosed with gastrointestinal lymphoma on the same endoscopy. High-risk gastric pathology was associated with increased time since diagnosis of CVID, smoking, Helicobacter pylori, a low-serum pepsinogen I concentration, and diarrhea, but not pepsinogen I/II ratio, iron studies, vitamin B12 levels or upper gastrointestinal symptoms. There was a lower rate of detection of IM when fewer biopsies were taken, and IM and gastric atrophy were rarely predicted by the endoscopist macroscopically, highlighting the need for standardized biopsy protocols. The prevalence of premalignant gastric lesions in patients with CVID highlights the need for routine gastric screening.

To validate the DSC test, we enrolled two series of individuals living in Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy (n = 53 and n = 113, respectively), who were referred for an endoscopy. The classification used for the DSC test to predict gastric cancer risk combines the coefficient of the patient's age and sex and serum pepsinogen I and II, gastrin 17, and anti-Helicobacter pylori immunoglobulin G concentrations in two equations: Y1 and Y2. The coefficient of variables and the Y1 and Y2 cutoff points (>0.385 and >0.294, respectively) were extrapolated using regression analysis and an ROC curve analysis of two retrospective datasets (300 cases for the Y1 equation and 200 cases for the Y2 equation). The first dataset included individuals with autoimmune atrophic gastritis and first-degree relatives with gastric cancer; the second dataset included blood donors. Demographic data were collected; serum pepsinogen, gastrin G17, and anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG concentrations were assayed using an automatic Maglumi system. Gastroscopies were performed by gastroenterologists using an Olympus video endoscope with detailed photographic documentation during examinations.

For detection, we first assess the value of known risk factors from the viewpoint of availability for cancer screening. Serum pepsinogen appears to be the most useful and realistic of the factors examined, although its adequacy needs to be assessed in high-risk populations other than those in Japan. Helicobacter pylori infection is known to be a universal risk factor (or gastric carcinogen), and several interventional studies have recently shown positive results. However, H. pylori infection can be eradicated from at-risk populations, thereby decreasing its availability for cancer screening. Smokers are thought to be at risk epidemiologically, but the efficacy of screening in this population has yet to be elucidated, and further studies are warranted. Gender and aging can be risk factors in Japanese populations; male gender and old age are predominant in the intestinal type of carcinoma which is dominant in Japan, although this is not the case in the West. As for early diagnosis of cancer, only endoscopy can be commonly used for the detection of gastritis-like EGC, seen as a faint mucosal irregularity or discoloration. To make early diagnosis more accurate, it is indispensable to carry out detailed endoscopy together with careful scrutiny of the mucosa using dye-spraying techniques. The remarkable progress of early diagnosis in Japan prompted the endoscopic treatment for less invasive EGCs. The first success was with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Although convenient, its therapeutic efficacy is inadequate, particularly for larger lesions. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has no limitation on resection size and is expected to replace surgery, although it needs a high level of skill and there are several technical problems to be solved.",2006,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:20,,745-765,,4,20,,Best Pract.

First, we pooled plasma samples matched by age and sex. We identified 17 differentially expressed Con A-bound glycoproteins, including 10 upregulated proteins and 7 downregulated proteins; these differences were significant (Student's t-test, p-value < 0.05). Furthermore, 2 of the upregulated proteins displayed expression levels that were increased by 2-fold or more in gastric cancer samples when compared with normal control samples. These proteins included leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG1) and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3 (ITIH3), and the expression levels were validated by Western blot analysis. Pathway and network analysis of the differentially expressed proteins by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed vital canonical pathways involving acute phase response signaling, the complement system, LXR/RXR activation, hematopoiesis from pluripotent stem cells, and primary immunodeficiency signaling. Our results suggest that Con A-bound LRG1 and ITIH3 may not be practically applicable as a robust biomarker for the early detection of gastric cancer. Additionally, three novel PTMs in ITIH3 were identified and include hexose-N-acetyl-hexosamine at asparagine-(41), trimethylation at aspartic acid-(290), and flavin adenine dinucleotide at histidine-(335). Biological significance Our study was to describe a combinatorial approach of Con A affinity chromatography, 1-D SDS-PAGE, and nano-LC/MS/MS that provides a label-free, comparative glycoproteomic quantification strategy for the investigation of glycoprotein profiles in plasma from gastric cancer patients versus healthy volunteers and to identify glycoprotein biomarkers for the early clinical detection of gastric cancer. Three novel PTMs, HexHexNAc, trimethylation and FAD, in Con A-bound ITIH3 were identified and built in molecular modeling. The aspartic acid-(290) trimethylation site was located in a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS motif;(290)-DXSXS...T...D-(313)) that may influence important function for binding protein ligands.

Proper control of miRNA expression is essential for maintaining a steady state of the cellular machinery. Recently, it was discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulate in the blood of both healthy and diseased patients, although ribonuclease is present in both plasma and serum. Most of the circulating miRNAs are included in lipid or lipoprotein complexes, such as apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, or exosomes, and are, therefore, highly stable. The existence of circulating miRNAs in the blood of cancer patients has raised the possibility that miRNAs may serve as a novel diagnostic marker. However, the secretory mechanism and biological function, as well as the meaning of the existence of extracellular miRNAs, remain largely unclear. In this review, we summarize the usefulness of circulating miRNA for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for the secretion and incorporation of miRNA into the cells.

Equipment-based image enhanced endoscopy (e-IEE) using narrow band imaging (NBI) and blue laser imaging (BLI) is useful to characterize known lesions with magnification at a close-up view. However, they are not useful for the early detection of superficial, pale neoplasms, or both because of the weak image at a distant view in a wide lumen such as the stomach or colon. Linked color imaging (LCI) is a novel pre- and post-processing technology developed by Fujifilm Corporation that has sufficient brightness to illuminate a wide lumen. LCI delineates early gastric cancers as orange-red and intestinal metaplasia as purple. LCI improves the adenoma detection rate in the colon and decreases the polyp miss rate. LCI contributes to the detection of superficial lesions throughout the gastrointestinal tract by enhancing the color contrast between the neoplasm and the surrounding mucosa. LCI can distinguish them by their specific color allocation based mainly on the distribution of capillaries.

Only photofluorography is considered to be an acceptable screening method so far, but recent evidence may show the usefulness of serum pepsinogen (PG) measurement for gastric cancer screening. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the feasibility of measuring serum PG levels for detection of gastric cancers. Serum PG levels (PGI/PGII) were measured in asymptomatic middle-aged Japanese between 1991 and 2005. Those with a PGI <= 70 ng/mL and PGI/PGII <= 3 were defined as having a positive PG test. According to the obtained results of serum PG levels and previous individual records, those with a positive PG test and those with a negative PG test took gastroendoscopy every 2 and 5 years, respectively. The total number of participating individuals was 101 892 (mean age of 48.7 years). In a total of 21 178 planned gastroendoscopies (20.8%), 13 789 (65.1%) underwent gastroendoscopy and 125 gastric cancers were detected, which corresponded to 0.12% of all participants and to 0.91% of those with gastroendoscopy. Early-stage cancers and intestinal-type intramucosal cancers accounted for 80% and 39% of all the detected cancers, respectively.

Although the Korean program seems to achieve a high-rate of uptake with increasing use of endoscopy, the work load is substantial. In the meantime, more attention in the world turns to primary prevention through eradication of Helicobacter pylori.

The National Endoscopy Quality Improvement (QI) program was initiated in 2009 to enhance the quality of medical institutions and improve the effectiveness of the National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP). The Korean Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy developed quality standards through a broad systematic review of other endoscopic quality guidelines and discussions with experts. The standards comprise five domains: qualifications of endoscopists, endoscopic unit facilities and equipment, endoscopic procedure, endoscopy outcomes, and endoscopic reprocessing. After 5 years of the QI program, feedback surveys showed that the perception of QI and endoscopic practice improved substantially in all domains of quality, but the quality standards need to be revised. How to avoid missing cancer in endoscopic procedures in daily practice was reviewed, which can be applied to the mass screening endoscopy.

Therefore, a population-based case-control study was conducted to evaluate the screening effect. The gastric cancer screening program was initiated in Linzhou in the year 2005, and endoscopic examination with indicative biopsy, for residents aged 40-69 years, was used to detect early cancer and precancerous lesion. In this study, cases were defined as individuals who had died of gastric cancer, which were selected from Linzhou Cancer Registry database. Controls were residents (six per case), who had not died of gastric cancer, from the same area as the case, and matched by gender and age (+/- 2 years). The exposure status, whether cases and controls ever attended the screening or not, was acquired by inspecting the well-documented screening records. Conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 313 cases and 1876 controls were included in our analysis.

The total number of endoscopic examinations has increased, particularly in clinics. Based on the national survey, the total number of participants in gastric cancer screening was 3 784 967. If 30% of the participants are switched from radiographic screening to endoscopic screening, approximately 1 million additional endoscopic examinations are needed. In Japan, the participation rates in gastric cancer screening and the number of hospitals and clinics offering upper gastrointestinal endoscopy vary among the 47 prefectures.

However, 16.7% of the medical districts are available for endoscopic screening within a 5% increase in the total number of endoscopic examinations.

However, exosomal IncRNA-GC1 and its potential role in GC are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the diagnostic value of circulating exosomal IncRNA-GC1 for early detection and monitoring progression of GC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a multiphase investigation of circulating exosomal IncRNA-GC1 for early detection of GC involving consecutive patients with GC (n = 522), patients with gastric precancerous lesions (n = 85), and healthy donor individuals (HDs; n = 219) from December 2016 to February 2019 a Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, China. LncRNA-GC1 was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction by independent researchers who had no access to patients' information. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to calculate diagnostic efficiency in comparison between IncRNA-GC1 and 3 traditional biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen [[EA], cancer antigen 72-4 [[A72-4], and CA19-9). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Assessment of diagnostic efficiency on the basis of area under curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity. RESULTS Of the 826 patients included in the study, 508 were men (615%), and the median age of all patients was 60 years (range, 28-82 years). In the test phase, IncRNA-GClachieved better diagnostic performance than the standard biomarkers CEA, CA72-4, and CA19-9 (AUC = 0.9033) for distinguishing between the patients with GC and HDs. Additionally, exosomal IncRNA-GC1 levels were significantly higher in culture media from GC cells compared with those of normal gastric epithelial cells (t = 5.310; P = .002). In the verification phase, IncRNA-GC1 retained its diagnostic efficiency in discriminating patients with GC from those with gastric precancerous lesions as well from HDs. Moreover, IncRNA-GC1 exhibited a higher AUC compared with those of CEA, CA72-4, and CA19-9 for early detection of GC with sufficient specificity and sensitivity, especially for patients with GC with negative standard biomarkers. Moreover, the levels of circulating exosomal IncRNA-GC1 were significantly associated with GC from early to advanced stages (HD vs stage I, t = 20.98; P < .001; stage I vs stage II, t = 2.787; P = .006; stage II vs stage III, t = 4.471; P < .001; stage III vs stage IV, t 1.023; P =.30), independent of pathological grading and Lauren classification (pathological grading: HD vs G1, t = 21.09; P < .001: G1 vs G2, t 0.3718; P.71; G2 vs G3, t 0.3598; P=.72: Lauren classification: t 24.81; P < .001). In the supplemental phase, the levels of circulating exosomal IncRNA-GC1 were consistent with those in GC tissues and cells and were higher compared with those in normal tissues and cells. Furthermore, the levels of circulating IncRNA-GClwere unchanged after exosomes were treated with RNase and remained constant after prolonged exposure to room temperature or after repeated freezing and thawing (t = 1.443; P = .39). Total circulating IncRNA-GC1 was nearly all packaged within exosomes rather than a free form in plasma. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVENCE Circulating exosomal IncRNA-GC1 may serve as a noninvasive biomarker for detecting early-stage GC and for monitoring disease progression. Combining circulating exosomal IncRNA-GC1 detection with endoscopy could improve the early diagnostic rate of GC.",Jul-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:02,,572-579,,7,155,,JAMA Surg.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: Chicago Publisher: Amer Medical Assoc Web of Science ID: WOS:000553150400012,,,,DIAGNOSIS; STATISTICS; CA19-9; CA72-4; CEA; 565,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cimetropium bromide and other antispasmodic agents are commonly administered as premedication to inhibit peristalsis during EGD examination, there are few data regarding the benefits of cimetropium bromide for the detection of gastric neoplasms. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between the use of cimetropium bromide as premedication and gastric neoplasm detection rates during EGD examination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study included 67 683 participants who received EGD screening at the Health Promotion Center of Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, from January 2, 2010, to June 30, 2017. Data were analyzed from April 1 to December 30, 2021. EXPOSURES Participants were divided into 2 groups: those who received cimetropium bromide before EGD examination (intervention group) and those who did not (control group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Gastric neoplasm detection rates. RESULTS Among 67 683 participants, the mean (SD) age was 48.6 (10.8) years, and 36 517 participants (54.0%) were male; all participants were Asian (a racially homogenous population). Of those, 28 280 participants (41.8%; mean [SD] age, 50.3 [10.6] years; 57.8% male) received cimetropium bromide, and 39 403 participants (58.2%; mean [SD] age, 47.4 [10.8] years; 51.2% male) did not. Propensity score matching based on confounding variables yielded 41 670 matched participants (20 835 pairs). Detected lesions included 52 dysplasias (0.12%), 40 early cancers (0.10%), 7 advanced cancers (0.02%), and 3 lymphomas (0.01%). Gastric neoplasm detection rates were significantly higher in the intervention group (63 participants [0.30%]) vs the control group (39 participants [0.19%]; P = .02). A significant difference in the combined detection rate of dysplasia and early gastric cancer was found between those in the intervention group (57 participants [0.27%]) vs the control group (35 participants [0.17%]; P = .02). For small gastric lesions (<1 cm), those who received cimetropium bromide had higher detection rates (24 participants [0.12%]) than those who did not (11 participants [0.05%]; P = .03). Lesions in the gastric body were detected significantly more often in the intervention group (34 participants [0.16%]) vs the control group (15 participants [0.07%]; P = .007). In multivariate analyses involving all 67 683 participants, the use of cimetropium bromide was more likely to detect gastric neoplasms compared with nonuse (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.95; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, the use of cimetropium bromide as premedication was significantly associated with increased gastric neoplasm detection rates during EGD screening, and lesions in the gastric body were detected more frequently among those who received cimetropium bromide compared with those who did not. These findings suggest that cimetropium bromide may be considered as premedication before EGD examination among individuals with no contraindications.",2022/3/23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,e223827,,3,5,,JAMA Netw.

Results Of 240 000 randomized adults (mean age, 58.1 years [SD, 5.6]; 46.8% female), 63 508 were invited for HPSA + FIT, and 88 995 were invited for FIT alone. Of the 240 000 randomized, 38 792 who were unreachable and 48 705 who did not receive an invitation were excluded. Of those invited, screening participation rates were 49.6% (31 497/63 508) for HPSA + FIT and 35.7% (31 777/88 995) for FIT alone. Among 12 142 participants (38.5%) with positive HPSA results, 8664 (71.4%) received antibiotic treatment, and eradication occurred in 91.9%. Gastric cancer incidence rates were 0.032% in the HPSA + FIT group and 0.037% in the FIT-alone group (mean difference, -0.005% [95% CI, -0.013% to 0.003%]; P = .23). Gastric cancer mortality rates were 0.015% in the HPSA + FIT group and 0.013% in the FIT-alone group (mean difference, 0.002% [95% CI, -0.004% to 0.007%]; P = .57). After adjusting for differences in screening participation, length of follow-up, and patient characteristics in post hoc analyses, an invitation for HPSA + FIT was associated with lower rates of gastric cancer (0.79 [95% CI, 0.63-0.98]) but not with gastric cancer mortality (1.02 [95% CI, 0.73-1.40]), compared with FIT alone. Among participants who received antibiotics, the most common adverse effects were abdominal pain or diarrhea (2.1%) and dyspepsia or poor appetite (0.8%). Conclusions and Relevance Among residents of Taiwan, an invitation to test for HPSA combined with FIT did not reduce rates of gastric cancer or gastric cancer mortality, compared with an invitation for FIT alone. However, when differences in screening participation and length of follow-up were accounted for, gastric cancer incidence, but not gastric cancer mortality, was lower in the HSPA + FIT group, compared with FIT alone.",2024/11/19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:50,,1642-1651,,19,332,,JAMA-J.

At present, the most widely used ICIs in clinical immunotherapy for a variety of solid tumors are monoclonal antibodies against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and their ligand PD-L1. However, tumor patients may induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs) while performing immunotherapy, and irAE is an obstacle to the prospect of ICI treatment. IrAE is a non-specific disease caused by immune system imbalance, which can occur in many tissues and organs. For example, skin, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine system and lung. Although the exact mechanism is not completely clear, related studies have shown that irAE may develop through many ways. Such as excessive activation of autoreactive T cells, excessive release of inflammatory cytokines, elevated levels of autoantibodies, and common antigens between tumors and normal tissues. Considering that the occurrence of severe IrAE not only causes irreversible damage to the patient's body, but also terminates immunotherapy due to immune intolerance. Therefore, accurate identification and screening of sensitive markers of irAE are the main beneficiaries of ICI treatment. Additionally, irAEs usually require specific management, the most common of which are steroids and immunomodulatory therapies. This review aims to summarize the current biomarkers for predicting irAE in gastric cancer and their possible mechanisms.",2023/11/8,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:53,,492,,1,28,,Eur. J. Med.

Early detection of gastric cancer through diagnostic markers can help establish effective treatments. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), presented in this review, is known to be regulated by a broad range of transcription factors, including those characterized in various malignant tumors, including gastric cancer. Particularly, it has been demonstrated that HSF1 regulation in various cancers is correlated with different processes, such as cell death, proliferation, and metastasis. Due to the effect of HSF1 on the initiation, development, and progression of various tumors, it is considered as an important gene for understanding and treating tumors. Additionally, HSF1 exhibits high expression in various cancers, and its high expression adversely affects the prognosis of various cancer patients, thereby suggesting that it can be used as a novel, predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic biomarker for gastric cancer. In this review, we discuss the literature accumulated in recent years, which suggests that there is a correlation between the expression of HSF1 and prognosis of gastric cancer patients through public data.

This study examined the difference in the spectral reflectance (SR) of gastric tumors and normal mucosa recorded with a hyperspectral camera equipped with HSI technology and attempted to determine the specific wavelength that is useful for the diagnosis of gastric cancer. A total of 104 gastric tumors removed by endoscopic submucosal dissection from 96 patients at Yamaguchi University Hospital were recorded using a hyperspectral camera. We determined the optimal wavelength and the cut-off value for differentiating tumors from normal mucosa to establish a diagnostic algorithm. We also attempted to highlight tumors by image processing using the hyperspectral camera's analysis software. A wavelength of 770 nm and a cut-off value of 1/4 the corrected SR were selected as the respective optimal wavelength and cut-off values. The rates of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the algorithm's diagnostic capability were 71%, 98%, and 85%, respectively.

Increased level of soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) in various tumor types has been reported. However, the potential diagnostic value of sHLA-G with other tumor markers in gastric cancer (GC) diagnosis is yet to be explored. In this study, plasma level of sHLA-G was measured in 81 GC patients, 53 benign gastric disease patients and 77 normal controls by ELISA. The serum levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and cancer antigen 72-4 (CA72-4) were also determined. Data showed that plasma level of sHLA-G in GC was dramatically increased compared with normal controls and benign gastric disease patients (both p < 0.001). The AUC for sHLA-G was 0.730 (p < 0.001), superior to serum AFP, CEA, CA125, CA19-9 and CA72-4. After evaluating three cut-offs of sHLA-G, we concluded sHLA-G (cut-off at 128 U/ml) plus CA125 in two-biomarker panel test and CA125 plus CA199 plus sHLA-G or CA125 plus CA724 plus sHLA-G in three-biomarker panel test were better choices for GC discrimination.

Gastroscopy with biopsy is the routine method for screening, and gastrectomy is the major therapeutic strategy for GC. However, in more than 30% of GC surgical patients, cancer has progressed too far for effective medical resection. Thus, useful biomarkers for early screening or detection of GC are essential for improving patients' survival rate. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in tumorigenesis. They contribute to gastric carcinogenesis by altering the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Because of their stability in tissues, serum/plasma and other body fluids, miRNAs have been suggested as novel tumor biomarkers with suitable clinical potential. Recently, aberrantly expressed miRNAs have been identified and tested for clinical application in the management of GC. Aberrant miRNA expression profiles determined with miRNA microarrays, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing approaches could be used to establish sample specificity and to identify tumor type. Here, we provide an up-to-date summary of tissue-based GC-associated miRNAs, describing their involvement and that of their downstream targets in tumorigenic and biological processes. We examine correlations among significant clinical parameters and prognostic indicators, and discuss recurrence monitoring and therapeutic options in GC. We also review plasma/serum-based, GC-associated, circulating miRNAs and their clinical applications, focusing especially on early diagnosis. By providing insights into the mechanisms of miRNA-related tumor progression, this review will hopefully aid in the identification of novel potential therapeutic targets.",Jun-16,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:12,,945,,6,17,,Int.

A bioinformatic analysis revealed that SATB1 3 '-untranslated region (3 '-UTR) and long noncoding RNA UCA1 (lncRNA-UCA1) might competitively bind to microRNA-495-3p (miR-495-3p). Interestingly, lncRNA-UCA1 is also an important contributor to GC. The current study aimed to demonstrate the potential interaction among SATB1/miR-495-3p/lncRNA-UCA1 network and their effects on GC proliferation and invasion. The expression in GC and paracancerous normal tissues were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down, and transfection assays were performed to determine the interaction among SATB1/miR-495-3p/lncRNA-UCA1 network in GC cells. GC proliferation and invasion were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, transwell invasion, and colony formation assays. Results showed higher expression of SATB1 and lncRNA-UCA1 but lower miR-495-3p expression in GC than in the normal tissues. In luciferase reporter assay, miR-495-3p bound to three seed sequences in SATB1 3 '-UTR but only one in lncRNA-UCA1. SATB1 knockdown increased the combination of miR-495-3p with lncRNA-UCA1 but decreased lncRNA-UCA1 expression. Decreased lncRNA-UCA1 was also observed with the mimics increased miR-495-3p. These data suggested that SATB1 3 '-UTR functions as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-495-3p and positively regulates lncRNA-UCA1. LncRNA-UCA1 knockdown only decreased SATB1 expression in MKN-45 cells but not in BGC-823 cells, which suggested that the regulatory effect of lncRNA-UCA1 on SATB1 by sponging miR-495-3p is cell-dependent. This study further identified that SATB1/miR-495-3p/lncRNA-UCA1 network is implicated in GC proliferation and invasion.

This led us to investigate the therapeutic function of TfR1 in GC. The clinical significance of TfR1 was assessed in 178 GC tissues by using a magneto-HFn nanoparticle-based immunohistochemistry method. The therapeutic effects of doxorubicin-loaded HFn nanocarriers (HFn-Dox) were evaluated on TfR1-positive GC patient-derived xenograft (GC-PDX) models. The biological function of TfR1 was investigated through in vitro and in vivo assays. TfR1 was upregulated (73.03%) in GC tissues, and reversely correlated with patient outcome. TfR1-negative sorted cells exhibited tumor-initiating features, which enhanced tumor formation and migration/invasion, whereas TfR1-positive sorted cells showed significant proliferation ability. Knockout of TfR1 in GC cells also enhanced cell invasion. TfR1-deficient cells displayed immune escape by upregulating PD-L1, CXCL9, and CXCL10, when disposed with IFN-gamma. Western blot results demonstrated that TfR1-knockout GC cells upregulated Akt and STAT3 signaling. Moreover, in TfR1-positive GC-PDX models, the HFn-Dox group significantly inhibited tumor growth, and increased mouse survival, compared with that of free-Dox group. TfR1 could be a potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarker for GC: (i) TfR1 reversely correlated with patient outcome, and its negative cells possessed tumor-aggressive features; (ii) TfR1-positive cells can be killed by HFn drug nanocarrier.

Most CDH1 truncating mutations are pathogenic, and several missense CDH1 mutations have a deleterious effect on E-cadherin function. CDH1 testing should be performed in probands. Screening of at-risk individuals is indicated from the age of consent following counselling with a multidisciplinary team. In mutation-positive individuals prophylactic gastrectomy is recommended. Endoscopic surveillance is an option for those refusing/postponing gastrectomy, those with mutations of undetermined significance, and in CDH1-negative families.

The cumulative risk for advanced gastric cancer in HDGC is 67% in men and 83% in women by 80 years of age. Early HDGC is characterized by multiple microscopic foci of intramucosal signet-ring cell carcinoma. The time to progression of these foci appears to be variable and currently is not predictable-the carcinoma foci may remain confined to the mucosa for many years. The management options for mutation carriers include prophylactic gastrectomy or surveillance gastroscopy. The only extensive published surveillance experience used chromogastroscopy, which detected early HDGC foci not visible on white-fight endoscopy. The use of new techniques such as confocal microscopy, spectroscopy, or autofluorescence may prove useful, but have not been studied in HDGC. In patients up to 20 years of age, the risk for gastric cancer is less than 1%; this risk is outweighed by the mortality and morbidity associated with total gastrectomy. It is therefore recommended that genetic testing should occur at :16 years of age and that annual surveillance chromogastroscopy also should begin at age 16 in identified CDH-1 mutation carriers. After 20 years of age, delaying prophylactic gastrectomy carries significant risk, particularly if the alternative is surveillance by white-light gastroscopy. Surveillance chromogastroscopy (Congo red/methylene blue technique) should be considered for individuals younger than 20 years and patients unwilling to undergo prophylactic gastrectomy. Sufficient evidence for an increased risk for lobular breast cancer in CDH-1 carriers exists to justify breast screening in female carriers older than 35 years of age, however, evidence is insufficient to recommend prophylactic mastectomy.",Mar-06,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:20,,262-275,,3,4,,Clin.

Primary prevention of GC should be addressed by avoiding exposure to factors that increase the risk and to promote factors associated with decrease risk. Vaccines against H. pylori are an ongoing promise and not yet available. Chemoprevention through vitamin supplementation has shown no benefit. Screening and eradication of H. pylori in the general population is not advised. Given that GC is a multiple-steps process, the identification of patients with preneoplastic lesions with high risk of progression, and periodic endoscopic surveillance of them represents the most effective way for early diagnosis of GC. However, clinical guidelines for surveillance are lacking and there are no clear criteria to classify patients into high or low risk of progressing to GC. No study has shown the potential usefulness of combining the information on the type of preneoplastic lesions, genetic and epigenetic, lifestyle and virulence bacterial factors in order to identify high risk patients who need more intensive surveillance.

In a big Japanese study, the risk of developing GC in patients with peptic ulcer disease who received H. pylori eradication therapy and annual endoscopic surveillance for a mean of 9.9 years was significantly lower after successful eradication therapy compared to the group with persistent infection (0.21%/year and 0.45%/year, respectively, p = .049). According to a recent meta-analysis, H. pylori eradication is insufficient in GC risk reduction in subjects with advanced precancerous conditions (i.e., intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia). A microsimulation model suggested screening smokers over the age of 50 in the U.S. for serum pepsinogens. This would allow to detect advanced gastric atrophy with endoscopic follow-up of subjects testing positive as a cost-effective strategy to reduce GC mortality. In a Taiwanese study, the anti-H. pylori IgG-based test-and-treat program had lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than that with 13 C-urea breath test in both sexes to prevent GC whereas expected years of life lost for GC were higher and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of test-and-treat programs were more cost-effective in young adults (30-69 years old) than in elders (>70 years old). With respect to gastrointestinal malignancies other than GC, a meta-analysis confirmed the inverse association between H. pylori infection and esophageal adenocarcinoma.

DNA methylation levels of marker genes (miR-124a-3, EMX1 and NKX6-1) in gastric mucosa were quantified by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. A multivariate beta regression model was used to investigate the association of pack-years of smoking and intakes of green/yellow vegetables, fruit and salt with methylation levels of marker genes. All analyses were stratified by H. pylori status. We found 2.5 to 34.1 times higher mean methylation levels among those with current H. pylori infection (n = 117) compared to those without (n = 164). After adjustment for potential confounders, we found increased levels of miR-124a-3 methylation according to pack-years of smoking and decreased levels of methylation according to green/yellow vegetable intake. We did not detect these associations among those without H. pylori infection.

In this study, GNA13 was characterized for its role in gastric cancer (GC) progression and underlying molecular mechanisms. The expression dynamics of GNA13 were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in two independent cohorts of GC samples. A series of in-vivo and in-vitro assays was performed to elucidate the function of GNA13 in GC and its underlying mechanisms. In both two cohorts of GC samples, we observed that GNA13 was markedly overexpressed in GC tissues and associated closely with aggressive magnitude of GC progression and poor patients' survival. Further study showed that upregulation of GNA13 expression increased the proliferation and tumorigenicity of GC cells in vitro and in vivo, by promoting cell growth rate, colony formation, and tumor formation in nude mice. By contrast, knockdown of GNA13 effectively suppressed the proliferation and tumorigenicity of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results also demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms of the effect of GNA13 in GC included promotion of G1/S cell cycle transition through upregulation of c-Myc, activation of AKT and ERK activity, suppression of FOXO1 activity, upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) regulator cyclin D1 and downregulation of CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.

We devised a support vector machine (SVM)-based analysis system to be used with the newly devised endoscopy system to quantitatively identify gastric cancer on images obtained by magnifying endoscopy with blue-laser imaging (BLI). We evaluated the usefulness of the computer system in combination with the new endoscopy system. Study: We evaluated the system as applied to 100 consecutive early gastric cancers in 95 patients examined by BLI magnification at Hiroshima University Hospital. We produced a set of images from the 100 early gastric cancers; 40 flat or slightly depressed, small, reddened lesions; and surrounding tissues, and we attempted to identify gastric cancer, reddened lesions, and surrounding tissue quantitatively. Results: The average SVM output value was 0.846 +/- 0.220 for cancerous lesions, 0.381 +/- 0.349 for reddened lesions, and 0.219 +/- 0.277 for surrounding tissue, with the SVM output value for cancerous lesions being significantly greater than that for reddened lesions or surrounding tissue. The average SVM output value for differentiated-type cancer was 0.840 +/- 0.207 and for undifferentiated-type cancer was 0.865 +/- 0.259.

Background: Immigrants in the United States (US) from countries with high per capita rates of gastric cancer remain at higher risk for gastric cancer. The existence of the possibly modifiable risk factor of H. pylori infection and the poor outcomes associated with late-stage disease make screening higher-risk groups with EGD an appealing possibility. It is unknown whether Asian immigrants in the US would accept an EGD-based strategy for gastric cancer screening. Study: Cross-sectional study of adult Chinese immigrants in New York City with dyspepsia who underwent EGD in an earlier gastric cancer detection study, who were offered a second EGD four years later. Our main outcome measure was acceptance or refusal of repeat EGD. Results: Seventy-three of the 115 Chinese participants in the earlier study were successfully contacted for this current study. Twenty-three of 73 (32%) underwent repeat EGD. Leading reasons given for declining were lack of symptoms and lack of time. Significantly associated with acceptance of repeat EGD was the belief that EGD will find stomach cancer ""nearly always"" in someone who has it (P = 0.0054; odds ratio = 14.0, 2.1 to 94.2 95% confidence interval). Conclusions: Acceptance of repeat EGD for gastric cancer detection in a cohort of Chinese immigrants was relatively low despite the mitigation of cost and language factors, 2 major barriers to healthcare access.

For early detection, more specific and sensitive biomarkers than the classic biomarkers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and C-reactive protein, are required. The present study focused on the evaluation of the potential of angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) as a novel biomarker for gastric cancer. The expression levels of ANGPTL2 in undifferentiated and differentiated gastric cancer cell lines (HGC-27 and MKN7, respectively) were therefore investigated. Additionally, ANGPTL2 levels in the serum of gastric cancer patients were compared with those of healthy individuals to evaluate the possibility of the protein as a predictive biomarker for gastric cancer. It was established that the expression levels of ANGPTL2 mRNA and protein were higher in undifferentiated HGC-27 cells than those in differentiated MKN7 cells. In a patient study, it was indicated that the levels of ANGPTL2 in the serum of gastric cancer patients were higher than those in healthy controls. The diagnostic performance of ANGPTL2 was assessed by constructing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and was evaluated by calculating the area under each ROC curve (AUC). For the discrimination of patients with gastric cancer from healthy individuals, the AUC for ANGPTL2 was 0.774 (P=0.005) (95% confidence interval, 0.615-0.933). These results suggested that ANGPTL2 was a potential biomarker for gastric cancer.",Apr-15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:14,,2653-2658,,4,11,,Mol. Med.

The prevention strategy should include all stages of primary and secondary prevention. The necessary steps to prevent gastric cancer are the following: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet, avoiding smoking and alcohol; serological screening of Helicobacter pylori infections and eradication; serological screening of atrophic gastritis in the population over 45 years of age and identification of severe atrophic gastritis with a high risk of developing gastric cancer; verification of atrophic gastritis and precancerous changes in the gastric mucosa using modern endoscopic (confocal laser endomicroscopy, narrow-spectrum imaging, and magnifying endoscopy) and morphological methods among patients with severe atrophic gastritis who were identified using serological screening; treatment of patients with atrophic gastritis during diagnosis verification; annual endoscopic and morphological monitoring of patients with atrophic gastritis during permanent treatment; annual serological monitoring of patients with atrophic gastritis who refused endoscopic and morphological monitoring; and radical treatment of patients with verified early gastric cancer. Ways to implement the algorithm for the global strategy for the prevention of gastric cancer (protocol of practical recommendations) are: State, government, and municipal programs; departmental programs of health departments; family doctors for patients who have a contract at the initiative of the doctor; family doctors for patients with a contract at the patient's initiative; and within private healthcare system where both doctors and patients can initiate the implementation of algorithm. ©The Author(s) 2024.

There is a great clinical need to realize the ultrasensitive detection of gene biomarkers in ctDNA. Here we reported that an ultrasensitive label-free biosensor was developed for the detection of the gastric cancer-related PIK3CA gene of ctDNA in peripheral blood. The polymeric L-arginine and graphene oxide-wrapped gold nanostars (rGO-AuNSs) were prepared and deposited on the glass electrode. The capturing DNA probes for the PIK3CA gene were prepared and successfully immobilized on the rGO-AuNS-modified electrode surface via pi-pi interaction among the rGO-AuNS composites and DNA probes. The resultant electrochemical sensor was effectively applied to detect the PIK3CA gene of ctDNA via the hybridization between the capturing DNA probe and ctDNA, the result of which showed that the biosensor exhibited desirable sensitivity, stability, and a wider dynamic response in a ctDNA concentration range from 1.0 x 10-20 to 1.0 x 10-10 M (R2 = 0.997). Moreover, the low limit of detection of 1.0 x 10-20 M (S/N = 3) indicates the biosensor owns satisfactory detection sensitivity. Fourteen PIK3CA genes and two PIK3CA gene mutations were detected in 60 clinical ctDNA samples of gastric cancer patients by using the developed biosensor. In conclusion, this ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical biosensor possesses a significant application prospect in the detection of the PIK3CA gene in ctDNA and in early screening for gastric cancer in the near future.",2022/11/21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/24 16:43,,5094-5103,,11,5,,ACS Appl.

Ten metabolite levels were found to be lower in stomach cancer cells relative to normal cells. Among those ten metabolites, four metabolites-ribose, proline, pyroglutamic acid, and glucose-were known to be linked to cancers. In particular, pyroglutamic acid level showed a drastic reduction of 22-fold in stomach cancer cells. Since glutamine and glutamic acid are known to undergo cyclization to pyroglutamic acid, the 22-fold reduction might be the actual reduction in the levels of glutamine and/or glutamic acid-both known to be cancer-related.

Finding biomarkers for early screening of gastric cancer and exploring new targets for gastric cancer treatment are urgent problems to be solved in the treatment of gastric cancer, with significant clinical outcomes for the survival rate of gastric cancer patients. The AAA+ family ATPase thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 13 (TRIP13) has been reported to play an essential role in developing various tumours. However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of TRIP13 in gastric cancer remain unclear. This study confirms that TRIP13 is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissue samples and that TRIP13 participates in the proliferation, migration, invasion in vitro, and tumourigenesis and metastasis in vivo of gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, this study confirms that TRIP13 directly interacts with DDX21 and stabilises its expression by restraining its ubiquitination degradation, thereby promoting gastric cancer progression. Additionally, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is an upstream factor of TRIP13, which could target the TRIP13 promoter region to promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. These results indicate that TRIP13 serve is a promising biomarker for the treating of gastric cancer patients, and the HDAC1-TRIP13/DDX21 axis might provide a solid theoretical basis for clinical treatment of gastric cancer patients.",2024/8/26,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:51,,622,,8,15,,Cell Death Dis.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 14 Place: London Publisher: Springernature Web of Science ID: WOS:001304521700004,,,,PROTEINS; AAA-ATPASE; APOPTOSIS; BUBR1; CDC20; COMPLEX; INHIBITION; RNA; SPINDLE-ASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT; 54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a homogeneous ensemble decision support system for gastric cancer screening (Endo-GCS) that performs word segmentation, feature extraction, and gastric cancer screening on text-based gastroscopy reports is proposed. The proposed Endo-GCS method establishes a progressive local weighting algorithm that improves the overall prediction performance of the homogeneous ensemble model in gastric cancer screening.

One of the underlying reasons for the poor survival outcomes in patients with these malignancies is late disease detection, typically when the tumor has already advanced and potentially spread to distant organs. Increasing evidence indicates that earlier detection of these cancers is associated with improved survival outcomes and, in some cases, allows curative treatments. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of molecular biomarkers that offer promise for screening, diagnosis, treatment selection, response assessment, and predicting the prognosis of these cancers. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous vesicles released from cells containing a repertoire of biological molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the most extensively studied noncoding RNAs, and the deregulation of miRNA levels is a feature of cancer cells. EVs miRNAs can serve as messengers for facilitating interactions between tumor cells and the cellular milieu, including immune cells, endothelial cells, and other tumor cells. Furthermore, recent years have witnessed considerable technological advances that have permitted in-depth sequence profiling of these small non-coding RNAs within EVs for their development as promising cancer biomarkers -particularly non-invasive, liquid biopsy markers in various cancers, including GI cancers. Herein, we summarize and discuss the roles of EV-associated miRNAs as they play a seminal role in GI cancer progression, as well as their promising translational and clinical potential as cancer biomarkers as we usher into the area of precision oncology.",Feb-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,5月23日,,,99,,Semin.

The characteristic tendency of GI cancers to reveal symptoms only in the malignant phase is the major contributing factor to its poor patient outcomes. Hence, it is critical to actively work towards identifying methods to diagnose this type of cancer in its early stages. Over the last decade, there has been robust research into identifying methods to detect GI cancers in their early stages with a particular emphasis on circulating biomarkers for this purpose. The present report is a review compounded from over 140 research papers on the emerging influence of circulating biomarkers in this regard. Circulating biomarker-based diagnosis via liquid biopsy offers several advantages over traditional diagnostic methods, such as colonoscopy, because the method is noninvasive; it can be used to monitor tumor load with respect to medication; and it can be used to predict recurrence. This review is largely divided into two relevant subtopics: biomarkers to diagnose gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors and genetic biomarkers used to diagnose common GI cancers. We focus on DNA-based biomarkers and the associated epigenetic dysregulation seen in these cancer types. Research into this area is urgently needed, and through this review chapter, the reader will gain a broad understanding of the various current uses of circulating biomarkers for both early diagnosis and prognosis of GI cancers.",2020,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:12,,,,4,25,,Crit.

We explored the expression data for those genes whose protein products can be detected in the plasma using the Cancer Genome Atlas to identify leading genes that are differentially regulated in patients with GE cancers. Our work predicted several candidates as potential biomarkers for distinct stages of GE cancers, including previously identified CST1, INHBA, STMN1, whose expression correlated with cancer recurrence, or resistance to adjuvant therapies or surgery. To define the predictive accuracy of these genes as possible biomarkers, we constructed a co-expression network and performed complex network analysis to measure the importance of the genes in terms of a ratio of closeness centrality (RCC). Furthermore, to measure the significance of these differentially regulated genes, we constructed an SVM classifier using machine learning approach and verified these genes by using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve as an evaluation metric. The area under the curve measure was>0.9 for both the overexpressed and downregulated genes suggesting the potential use and reliability of these candidates as biomarkers.

The pathogenesis to gastric cancer is proposed by the Correa hypothesis as the transition from normal gastric epithelium to invasive cancer via inflammation followed by intramucosal cancer and invasion. Multiple risk factors have been associated with the development of gastric intestinal metaplasia interplay, including Helicobacter pylori infection and associated genomics, host genetic factors, environmental milieu, rheumatologic disorders, diet, and intestinal microbiota. Globally, screening guidelines have been established in countries with high incidence. In the United States, no such guidelines have been developed due to lower, albeit increasing, incidence. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends a case-by-case patient assessment based upon epidemiology, genetics, and environmental risk factors. Studies have examined the use of a serologic biopsy to stratify risk based upon factors such as H pylori status and virulence factors, along with serologic markers of chronic inflammation including pepsinogen I, pepsinogen II, and gastrin. High-risk patients may then be advised to undergo endoscopic evaluation with mapping biopsies from the antrum (greater curvature, lesser curvature), incisura angularis, and corpus (greater curvature, lesser curvature).

Early detection is critical for successful treatment of gastric cancer, and examination of BAs in urine may provide a critical diagnostic tool for identifying gastric cancer at stages when it can still be cured. Bile acids (BAs) are a crucial toxic factor correlated with the injury of gastric mucosa and as such, quantifying the amount of BA in patient's urine could provide a new means to quickly and non-invasively identify the presence of gastric cancer in the early stages. Here, a covalent organic framework (COF) material synthesized on the basis of 1,3,5-tris(4-nitrophenyl)benzene (TAPB) and pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) was used as stationary phase for SPE column that was coupled to LC-MS/MS for quantitative analysis of eight BAs in human urine, including cholic acid (CA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). The enrichment effect of synthesized COF material was better than commercial SPE and HLB column. The sensitivity can increase 9.37-to 54.30-fold (calculated by the ratio of peak area between before and after enrichment). The probable mechanism is due to the great porosity and the similar polarity with BAs of the COF material. By compared with previous literatures, our method had the minimum limit of detection, which achieved 46.40, 25.75, 47.40, 47.37, 30.42, and 33.92 pg /mL, respectively, for GCA, GCDCA, CA , CDCA , HDCA and DCA after enrichment. These eight BAs also accomplished excellent linearity from 0.34 to 10,0 0 0 ng/mL. This material was successfully applied in the measurements of these six BAs in human urine from 76 gastric cancer patients and 32 healthy people. Compared to healthy people, levels of CA, CDCA, DCA, and HDCA were significantly elevated and levels of GCDCA were depressed, respectively, in gastric cancer patients. Our work suggests that these acids may act as potential biomarkers for gastric cancer and our framework provides a method for ""non-invasive"" diagnosis of gastric cancer. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the pathogenesis of this disease will benefit diagnosis and resolution. Studies show that miRNAs are involved in the tumorigenesis of gastric carcinoma. An initial screening followed by subsequent validation identified that miR-376c is up-regulated in gastric carcinoma tissue and the plasma of patients with the disease. In addition, the urinary level of miR-376c is also significantly increased in gastric carcinoma patients. The plasma miR-376c level was validated as a biomarker for gastric carcinoma, including early stage tumors. The induction of miR-376c was found to enrich the proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth of carcinoma cells and, furthermore, the repression of the expression of endogenous miR-376c was able to reduce such oncogenic phenotypes. ARID4A gene is a direct target of miR-376c. Knockdown of endogenous ARID4A increased the oncogenicity of carcinoma cells, while ARID4A was found to be drastically down-regulated in tumor tissue. Thus, expression levels of miR-376c and ARID4A mRNA tended to be opposing in tumor tissue. Our results demonstrate that miR-376c functions by suppressing ARID4A expression, which in turn enhances the oncogenicity of gastric carcinoma cells.

CpG methylation is a central mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation affecting cancer-related genes, and occurs early in gastric carcinogenesis. DNA samples from non-metaplastic gastric mucosa with variable levels of gastritis (non-metaplastic mucosa), intestinal metaplasia, or gastric cancer were screened with methylation arrays for CpG methylation of cancer-related genes and 30 gene targets were further characterized by high-definition bisulfite next-generation sequencing. In addition, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed for correlation of methylation with gene expression. Overall, 13 genes had significantly increased CpG methylation in gastric cancer vs non-metaplastic mucosa (BRINP1, CDH11, CHFR, EPHA5, EPHA7, FGF2, FLI1, GALR1, HS3ST2, PDGFRA, SEZ6L, SGCE, and SNRPN). Further, most of these genes had corresponding reduced expression levels in gastric cancer compared with intestinal metaplasia, including novel hypermethylated genes in gastric cancer (FLI1, GALR1, SGCE, and SNRPN), suggesting that they may regulate neoplastic transformation from non-malignant intestinal metaplasia to cancer. Our data suggest a tumor-suppressor role for FLI1 in gastric cancer, consistent with recently reported data in breast cancer. For the genes with strongest methylation/expression correlation, namely FLI1, the expression was lowest in microsatellite-unstable tumors compared with other gastric cancer molecular subtypes. Importantly, reduced expression of hypermethylated BRINP1 and SGCE was significantly associated with favorable survival in gastric cancer. In summary, we report novel methylation gene targets that may have functional roles in discrete stages of gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer.",Feb-16,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:12,,182-193,,2,29,,Mod.

The survival rate of gastric cancer patients depends on early detection and treatment. The widespread adoption of endoscopy has improved the detection rate of early gastric cancer. Accurate preoperative diagnosis of early gastric cancer is key to developing individualized treatment strategies. Here, nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) is used to differentiate between normal gastric mucosae and those with early gastric cancer. Furthermore, the quantitative relationship between submucosal infiltration depth and collagen signals in early gastric cancer is explored. First, the two-dimensional collagen direction angle was measured as an indicator to identify cancerous tissue. The orientation indexes of collagen fibers in normal and cancerous tissues were found to be 0.8511 +/- 0.0839 and 0.6466 +/- 0.07429 (P < 0.0001), respectively, indicating a significant decrease for the cancerous site. The backscattered second harmonic generation (SHG) signal corresponding to the collagen content and the three-dimensional collagen fiber orientation were then studied for early gastric cancer at different infiltration depths. The backscattered collagen SHG signal (a.u.) in the infiltrated lamina propria, muscularis mucosa, and submucosa were found to be 0.1850 +/- 0.0393, 0.0870 +/- 0.0189, and 0.0435 +/- 0.0163, respectively. The 3D directional variance of collagen corresponding to the three infiltration depth sites were 0.6108 +/- 0.0707, 0.6794 +/- 0.0610, and 0.8200 +/- 0.0618 (P < 0.05), respectively. Significant differences between the early gastric cancer collagen signals at different infiltration depths were observed. Our results indicate that NLOM can differentiate cancerous tissue from normal tissue, and thus diagnose early gastric cancer based on infiltration depth.

However, despite the benefits of endoscopic screening for gastric cancer, its major harms include infection, complications, false-negative results, false-positive results, and overdiagnosis. The most serious harm of endoscopic screening is overdiagnosis and this can occur in any cancer screening programs. Overdiagnosis is defined as the detection of cancers that would never have been found if there is no cancer screening. Overdiagnosis has been estimated from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and modeling. It can be calculated on the basis of a comparison of the incidence of cancer between screened and unscreened individuals after the follow-up. Although the estimation method for overdiagnosis has not yet been standardized, estimation of overdiagnosis is needed in endoscopic screening for gastric cancer. To minimize overdiagnosis, the target age group and screening interval should be appropriately defined.

Acquired metabolomic data was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test to find the tissue metabolic biomarkers for gastric cancer. A diagnostic model for gastric cancer was constructed using principal component analysis (PCA), and was assessed with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results showed that 18 metabolites were detected differently between the malignant tissues and the adjacent non-malignant tissues of gastric mucosa.

Previous cohort studies and case-control studies have demonstrated reduced gastric cancer mortality in study populations that had undergone gastric cancer screening with radiographic tests. Recently, a case-control study in Japan reported a 30% reduction in gastric cancer mortality when screening was undertaken via endoscopy. Also, endoscopic screening for gastric cancer exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity than radiographic screening. Moreover, most cost-effectiveness analyses on the best strategy for detecting early gastric cancer have generally concluded that endoscopy is more cost-effective than radiographic testing. Although data on the impact of endoscopy screening programs on gastric cancer mortality are limited, recent study results suggest that gastric cancer screening by endoscopy in average-risk populations performs better than radiography screening.

In Korea, screening endoscopy has been performed nationwide since 1999. The aim of this study was to elucidate the benefit of screening endoscopy on actual survival in gastric cancer patients and to determine the optimal interval of screening endoscopy. We analyzed 1651 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical treatment between June 2008 and December 2014.

However, endoscopic screening is presently in the last trial phase of development before their introduction to population-based screening. To effectively introduce new techniques for gastric cancer screening in a community, incidence and mortality reduction from gastric cancer must be initially and thoroughly evaluated by conducting reliable studies.

This study focuses on BRD4 expression and its correlation with miR-26a-3p, DLG5-AS1, and JMJD1C-AS1 lncRNAs in gastric cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets revealed significant upregulation of BRD4 in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating negatively with miR-26a-3p and positively with DLG5-AS1 and JMJD1C-AS1 lncRNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed these findings in 25 gastric cancer tissue samples and 25 normal samples. BRD4's overexpression was associated with reduced survival rates and older patient age. MiR-26a-3p, a known tumor suppressor, showed decreased expression in gastric cancer tissues, with ROC analysis suggesting it, alongside BRD4, as a potential diagnostic biomarker. Additionally, bioinformatics predicted miR-26a-3p's interaction with BRD4 mRNA. Upregulated lncRNAs DLG5-AS1 and JMJD1C-AS1 likely act as competing endogenous RNAs, sponging miR-26a-3p, thus promoting BRD4 dysregulation. These lncRNAs have not been previously studied in gastric cancer. The findings propose a novel BRD4/lncRNA/miRNA regulatory axis in gastric cancer, highlighting the potential of BRD4, DLG5-AS1, and JMJD1C-AS1 as biomarkers for early diagnosis.

The expression of GSE1 was observed to be much higher in human gastric cancer tissues compared with normal gastric tissues, and GSE1 expression correlated positively with lymph node metastasis, histological grade, depth of invasion, and clinical stage in gastric cancer patients. Moreover, GSE1 expression was also associated with decreased post-operative relapse-free survival and overall survival in the cohort. The forced expression of GSE1 in gastric cancer cell lines resulted in increased cell proliferation, increased colony formation, enhanced cell migration, and invasion. Furthermore, forced expression of GSE1 also increased tumor size and enhanced lung metastasis in xenograft models. The depletion of endogenous GSE1 with shRNAs decreased the oncogenicity and invasiveness of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, GSE1 was determined to be a direct target of miR-200b and miR-200c. Furthermore, GSE1 positively regulated the downstream gene SLC7A5 (also known as LAT-1), which was scanned and verified from mRNA sequencing. GSE1 therefore possesses an oncogenic role in human gastric cancer, and targeted therapeutic approaches to inhibit GSE1 function in gastric cancer warrant further consideration.",2018/3/16,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,3949-3964,,11,293,,J.

There is near-universal agreement that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a preferred management for locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). However, the optimal approach for an individual patient is still not clear and remains controversial, which could be at least partly explained by the lack of predictive tools. The ability to predict chemosensitivity from NAC in routine clinical practice is difficult and is an area of intense investigation, especially in the Precision-Medicine Era. Available consistent evidence suggests that a favorable tumor histopathological response to NAC may be a useful positive prognostic marker in gastric cancer. Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that making the histopathological response from NAC predictable will dramatically facility the NAC and improve patients' outcome. This review provides an overview on the current status of predictive biomarkers for histopathological response from NAC in LAGC, including clinicopathological variables, imaging and molecular testing.

Population-based screening is being undertaken in Korea and Japan, where gastric cancer incidence rates are high, and seems to be effective in reducing mortality from gastric cancer. However, such strategies are difficult to implement in countries with a low incidence or limited resources. Thus, screening strategies should be directed towards high-risk population subgroups. Gastric cancer has a relatively long mean sojourn time, and prognosis of early-stage disease is excellent. In general population, screening at 2-year interval in Korea seems to be effective for early-stage diagnosis. In subjects with atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia, surveillance is recommended at 1 to 3 years intervals according to European and Japanese recommendation. Screening intervals for family members with sporadic gastric cancer has not yet been adequately evaluated, but 1-year interval is recommended for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer family-members. Gastric cancer patients treated by endoscopic resection are the highest-risk group, and 1-year interval surveillance can detect most metachronous gastric cancers at an early stage. Future gastric cancer surveillance strategies using endoscopy should be guided by risk-stratification assessment, and further refinement of optimal surveillance intervals is needed.",2014,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:11,,,,6,47,,Clin.

This study employs a multifaceted strategy integrating network biology, drug repurposing, and virtual screening to elucidate and expand the molecular landscape of gastric cancer. We identified and prioritized key genes implicated in gastric cancer by utilizing data from diverse databases and text-mining techniques. Network analysis underscored intricate gene interactions, emphasizing potential therapeutic targets such as CTNNB1, BCL2, TP53, etc, and highlighted ACTB among the top hub genes crucial in disease progression. Drug repurposing on 626 FDA-approved drugs for digestive system-related cancers revealed Norgestimate and Nimesulide as likely top candidates for gastric cancer, validated by molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Further, combinatorial synthesis of scaffold libraries derived from known chemotypes generated 56,160 virtual compounds, of which 76 new compounds were prioritized based on promising binding affinities and interactions at critical residues. Hotspot residue analysis identified GLU 214 and others as essential for ligand binding stability, enhancing compound efficacy and specificity. These findings support the therapeutic potential of targeting beta-actin protein in gastric cancer treatment, suggesting a future for further experimental validation and clinical translation.

Although many treatment options exist for patients with gastric tumors, the incidence and mortality rate of gastric cancer are on the rise. The early stages of gastric cancer are non-symptomatic, and the treatment response is unpredictable. This situation is further aggravated by a lack of diagnostic biomarkers that can aid in the early detection and prognosis of gastric cancer and in the prediction of chemoresistance. Moreover, clinical surgical specimens are rarely obtained, and traditional biomarkers of gastric cancer are not very effective. Many studies in the field of proteomics have contributed to the discovery and establishment of powerful diagnostic tools (e.g., ProteinChip array) in the management of cancer. The evolution in proteomic technologies has not only enabled the screening of a large number of samples but also enabled the identification of pathologically significant proteins, such as phosphoproteins, and the quantitation of difference in protein expression under different conditions. Multiplexed assays are used widely to accurately fractionate various complex samples such as blood, tissue, cells, and Helicobacter pylori-infected specimens to identify differentially expressed proteins. Biomarker detection studies have substantially contributed to the areas of secretome, metabolome, and phosphoproteome. Here, we review the development of potential biomarkers in the natural history of gastric cancer, with specific emphasis on the characteristics of target protein convergence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Screening programs have been shown to be effective in reducing the mortality rate through early detection; however, many factors hinder the widespread implementation of these programs in low resource settings due to their high capital cost (associated mainly with cable driven units), limited portability, and reprocessing/ contamination concerns. The Hydrojet endoscopic platform was developed as a low-cost alternative for gastric cancer screening in low-income countries. The capsule, completely made of bio-compatible plastic through rapid prototyping, uses pressurized water ejected from miniature nozzles to inspect the stomach. In order to achieve full controllability of the system inside the stomach, force characterization of the water jet actuators is needed. This work aimed to: i) characterize the relationship between thrust (with changes in outer diameter) and flow rate of miniature nozzles fabricated by rapid prototyping and ii) estimate the error due to the fabrication process. Results show that the experimental reaction thrust has a comparable trend to the analytical model hence a shape coefficient can be calculated and the actual thrust estimated at each point. Experimental results show the error due to rapid prototyping to be linear, thereby allowing for algorithmic compensation. (C) 2016 TheAuthors.

The majority of cases occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where endoscopy resources are traditionally limited. In this paper, we introduce a platform designed to enable inexpensive gastric screening to take place in remote areas of LMIC. The system consists of a swallowable endoscopic capsule connected to an external water distribution system by a multichannel soft tether. Pressurized water is ejected from the capsule to orient the view of the endoscopic camera. After completion of a cancer screening procedure, the outer shell of the capsule and the soft tether can be disposed, while the endoscopic camera is reclaimed without needing further reprocessing. The capsule, measuring 12 mm in diameter and 28 mm in length, is able to visualize the inside of the gastric cavity by combining waterjet actuation and the adjustment of the tether length. Experimental assessment was accomplished through a set of bench trials, ex vivo analysis, and in vivo feasibility validation. During the ex vivo trials, the platform was able to visualize the main landmarks that are typically observed during a gastric cancer screening procedure in less than 8 min. Given the compact footprint, the minimal cost of the disposable parts, and the possibility of running on relatively available and inexpensive resources, the proposed platform can potentially widen gastric cancer screening programs in LMIC.",May-15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:14,,1324-1332,,5,62,,IEEE Trans.

Recently, mounting evidence indicates the potential role of miRNAs in the diagnosis and assessing the prognosis of cancers. In the state-of-art research in cancer, machine-learning (ML) has gained increasing attention to find clinically useful biomarkers. The present study aimed to identify potential diagnostic and prognostic miRNAs in GC with the application of ML. Using the TCGA database and ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, k-NN, etc., a panel of 29 was obtained. Among the ML algorithms, SVM was chosen (AUC:88.5%, Accuracy:93% in GC). To find common molecular mechanisms of the miRNAs, their common gene targets were predicted using online databases such as miRWalk, miRDB, and Targetscan. Functional and enrichment analyzes were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Database of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), as well as identification of protein-protein interactions (PPI) using the STRING database. Pathway analysis of the target genes revealed the involvement of several cancer-related pathways including miRNA mediated inhibition of translation, regulation of gene expression by genetic imprinting, and the Wnt signaling pathway. Survival and ROC curve analysis showed that the expression levels of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-133a, hsa-miR-146b, and hsa-miR-29c were associated with higher mortality and potentially earlier detection of GC patients.

Understanding the molecular structure of gastric carcinogenesis might identify new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this disease. Thus, early detection of gastric cancer is a key measure to reduce the mortality and improve the prognosis of gastric cancer. There have recently been several reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) circulate in highly stable, cell-free forms in blood. Because serum and plasma miRNAs are relatively easy to access, circulating miRNAs also have great potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers. Although a number of miRNAs associated with gastric cancer have been identified, the underlying mechanism of these miRNAs in tumorigenesis and tumor progression remains to be investigated. The purpose of this study is to identify the potential of serum miRNAs as biomarkers for early detection of gastric cancer patients. RNA was isolated using the High Pure miRNA Isolation Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA and preamplification protocols were obtained from the isolated plasma miRNAs. The BioMark (TM) 96.96 Dynamic Array (Fluidigm Corporation) for real-time qPCR was used to simultaneously quantite the expression of 740 miRNAs. All statistical analyses were performed using the Biogazelle's qbase PLUS 2.0 software. In this study, among 740 miRNAs that we analyzed only miR-195-5p was significantly (p < 0.05, fold changes = 13, 3) down-regulated in gastric cancer patients compared with control. We demonstrated that miR-195-5p is a novel tumor suppressor miRNA and may contribute to gastric carcinogenesis.

More than 80% of diagnoses occur at the middle to late stage of the disease, highlighting an urgent need for novel biomarkers detectable at earlier stages. Recently, aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) have received a great deal of attention as potential sensitive and accurate biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This review summarizes the current knowledge about potential miRNA biomarkers for gastric cancer that have been reported in the publicly available literature between 2008 and 2013. Available evidence indicates that aberrantly expressed miRNAs in gastric cancer correlate with tumorigenesis, tumor proliferation, distant metastasis and invasion. Furthermore, tissue and cancer types can be classified using miRNA expression profiles and next-generation sequencing. As miRNAs in plasma/serum are well protected from RNases, they remain stable under harsh conditions. Thus, potential functions of these circulating miRNAs can be deduced and may implicate their diagnostic value in cancer detection. Circulating miRNAs, as well as tissue miRNAs, may allow for the detection of gastric cancer at an early stage, prediction of prognosis, and monitoring of recurrence and/or lymph node metastasis. Taken together, the data suggest that the participation of miRNAs in biomarker development will enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic and prognostic tests for gastric cancer.

The early gastric cancer (EGC) on the other side is potentially curable, and in selected cases endoscopic resection techniques offer similar survival rates then surgical resection. The detection of EGC is endoscopically challenging and requires high quality examination. Recent data show that close to 10% of the gastric cancer cases had a previous negative endoscopy. This highlights the urgent need to improve the quality of the endoscopy services, what can be achieved by increasing the awareness of gastroenterologists and continuously monitoring the key performance indicators of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Newer endoscopic imaging techniques are also becoming commonly available to aid the detection of gastric premalignant lesions and EGC. High-definition endoscopy with image enhancement techniques is preferred over white light endoscopy to recognize these lesions, and they are also useful to determine the invasion depth of EGC. The endoscopic optical characterization of lesions is necessary for the selection of proper resection method and decide whether endoscopic resection techniques can be considered. Artificial intelligence systems aid the detection of EGC and can help to determine the depth of invasion. Endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection requires centralized care and tertiary referral centers with appropriate expertise to ensure proper patient selection, high success rate and low adverse event rate. Appropriately scheduled endoscopic surveillance of high-risk patients, premalignant lesions and after resection of EGC is also important in the early detection and successful treatment of gastric cancer.",2023/4/4,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,1122454,,1122454,10,,Front.

A systematic review of the literature between January 1995 and December 2014 was performed. Studies that compared screened versus nonscreened populations for the diagnosis of gastric cancer and included the stage at diagnosis were analyzed. The QUADAS-2 and the ROBANS tools were used to assess the quality of the studies. A total of 11 studies from the Far East comprising 4039 participants in the screened and 6635 in the nonscreened groups were included. Screening was associated with a significant increase in the detection of early gastric cancer (EGC) [pooled odds ratio (POR)=3.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.01-5.06; P < 0.0001] and reduction in the incidence of advanced gastric cancer (POR=0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.35; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, screening improved the 5-year survival significantly (hazard ratio=0.56; 95% CI, 0.48-0.66; P < 0.0001). About 73% of the screened patients were found to have EGC compared with 43% of the nonscreened patients. About 8% of the screened patients were found to have advanced gastric cancer compared with 54% of the nonscreened patients. Screening for gastric cancer is useful in detecting asymptomatic patients with EGC in high-prevalence areas. This in turn increases the number of treatable cancers and improves the 5-year survival.

The beneficial effects of the current NCSP on early cancer detection, cost-effectiveness, and mortality reduction are evident.

Targeting gastric cancers with amplified or abnormally activated MET may have therapeutic benefit based on nonclinical and emerging clinical findings. However, one of the major problems of therapies targeting tyrosine kinases is that many tumors are not responsive to treatment or eventually develop resistance to the drugs. This study aims to understand the mechanisms of MET resistance in gastric SNU-5 xenografts which developed resistance to PHA665752, a MET inhibitor, through long-period tyrosine kinase inhibitor exposure. In the current study, we found that PI3K p110 alpha is overexpressed in PHA665752-resistant SNU-5 xenografts. These findings showed that high PI3K p110 alpha expression contributes to tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. In addition, we reported the development of a carcinogen-induced gastric cancer model that recapitulates PI3K p110 alpha expression in human disease, which will serve as a useful model to study PI3K p110 alpha's biology and its effectiveness as a novel biomarker and a molecular target for gastric cancer.

Both Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were subsequently used to investigate the function of dysregulated long noncoding RNAs and messenger RNAs. Cis and trans action was used to predict the possible targets of long noncoding RNAs, and a coexpression network was created to simulate the complex intergenic interactions. Ninety-five dysregulated long noncoding RNAs and 123 messenger RNAs were identified, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate 6 filtered long noncoding RNAs. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses identified several remarkably biological processes and signaling pathways, including spliceosome, RNA transport, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The transcriptional factors MYC, GABPA, and E2F1 were found to play a central function in the long noncoding RNAs process, as indicated by the coexpression network. This study revealed the dysregulated long noncoding RNA profiles of mucosal gastric cancer. The results shed light on the biological function of long noncoding RNAs in gastric cancer pathogenesis. This provides useful information for exploring potential early screening biomarkers in gastric cancer.",2020/5/28,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:03,,1.53303E+15,,1.53303E+15,19,,Technol. Cancer Res.

Due to its intricate initiation and progression mechanisms, early detection and effective treatment of gastric cancer are difficult to achieve. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is characterized as a fundamental process that is critical for embryonic development, wound healing and fibrotic disease. Recent evidence has established that aberrant EMT activation in the human stomach is closely associated with gastric carcinogenesis and tumor progression. EMT activation endows gastric epithelial cells with increased characteristics of mesenchymal cells and reduces their epithelial features. Moreover, mesenchymal cells tend to dedifferentiate and acquire stem cell or tumorigenic phenotypes such as invasion, metastasis and apoptosis resistance as well as drug resistance during EMT progression. There are a number of molecules that indicate the stage of EMT (e.g., E-cadherin, an epithelial cell biomarker); therefore, certain transcriptional proteins, especially E-cadherin transcriptional repressors, may participate in the regulation of EMT. In addition, EMT regulation may be associated with certain epigenetic mechanisms. The aforementioned molecules can be used as early diagnostic markers for gastric cancer, and EMT regulation can provide potential targets for gastric cancer therapy. Here, we review the role of these aspects of EMT in gastric cancer initiation and development. (C) 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

In patients with chronic gastric ulcer, especially healing or healed benign ulcer, we took the biopsy specimens from both the edges and the base of ulcers in the follow-up.

We first used quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to evaluate the expression levels of hsa_circ_0005654 in 301 tissues, including 122 healthy gastric mucosa samples, 68 paired tissues from early gastric cancer and adjacent nontumor mucosae obtained by submucosal dissection, and 43 chronic gastritis tissues. Then, we analyzed the relationship between the expression levels of hsa(-)circ(-)0005654 and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with early gastric cancer. We ultimately confirmed the clinical diagnostic value of hsa(-)circ(-)0005654 through generating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and comparing the areas under the ROC curves (AUCs). Our data revealed that hsa_circ_0005654 was significantly downregulated in early gastric cancer tissues compared with matched normal mucosae (P < 0.001).

Apart from Japan, where screening programmes have resulted in early diagnosis in asymptomatic patients, in most countries the diagnosis of gastric cancers is invariably made on account on dyspeptic and alarm symptoms, which may also be of prognostic significance when reported by the patient at diagnosis. However, their use as selection criteria for endoscopy seems to be inconsistent since alarm symptoms are not sufficiently sensitive to detect malignancies. In fact, the overall prevalence of these symptoms in dyspeptic patients is high, while the prevalence of gastro-intestinal cancer is very low. Moreover, symptoms of early stage cancer may be indistinguishable from those of benign dyspepsia, while the presence of alarm symptoms may imply an advanced and often inoperable disease. The features of dyspeptic and alarm symptoms may reflect the pathology of the tumour and be of prognostic value in suggesting site, stage and aggressiveness of cancer. Alarm symptoms in gastric cancer are independently related to survival and an increased number, as well as specific alarm symptoms, are closely correlated to the risk of death. Dysphagia, weight loss and a palpable abdominal mass appear to be major independent prognostic factors in gastric cancer, while gastro-intestinal bleeding, vomiting and also duration of symptoms, do not seem to have a relevant prognostic impact on survival in gastric cancer.

Despite advances in medical technologies, screening methods, and public awareness, gastric cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early gastric cancer frequently does not present with characteristic symptoms, while advanced stage disease is characterized by a dismal prognosis. As such, early screening in gastric cancer is of great importance. In recent years, advances have been made globally in both clinical and basic research for the screening of early gastric cancer. The current predominant screening methods for early gastric cancer include imaging screening, endoscopic screening and serum biomarker screening. Imaging screening encompasses upper gastrointestinal barium meal, multidimensional spiral computed tomography (MDCT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography. Endoscopic screening methods include white light endoscopy, chromoendoscopy, computed virtual chromoendoscopy, and other endoscopic techniques like endocytoscopy, confocal laser endomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography and so on. Biomarkers screening involves the assessment of conventional biomarkers such as CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 as well as more emerging biomarkers such as peptides (PG, G-17, GCAA, TAAs and others), DNA (cfDNA, DNA methylation, MSI), noncoding RNA (miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, and tsRNA) and others.

As a result, compared to the controls, eleven cytokines were found to be significantly increased in gastric cancer, including interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1), neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 3 (Notch-3), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 19L (TNFRSF19L), growth hormone receptor (GHR), signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family 8 (SLAMF8), folate receptor beta (FR-beta), integrin alpha 5, galectin-8, erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A1 (EphA1), epiregulin, and fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF-12) with P<0.05. ELISA validation supported the results of the antibody array. More importantly, most of these eleven cytokines, including IFNGR1, TNFRSF19L, GHR, SLAMF8, FR-beta, and integrin alpha 5 were discovered to be elevated in gastric cancer serum samples for the first time in this study, suggesting that these proteins may serve as novel biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prognosis determination of gastric cancer.",Apr-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,1576-1583,,4,8,,Cancer Med.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000477027100025,,,,gastric cancer; EXPRESSION; RECURRENCE; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; biomarkers; PROTEIN; BINDING; serum; FAMILY; CARCINOMAS; antibody array; FOLATE RECEPTOR-ALPHA; GALECTIN-8; 695,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current clinical gold standard for detection is histopathological image analysis, but this process is manual, laborious, and time-consuming. As a result, there has been growing interest in developing computer-aided diagnosis to assist pathologists. Deep learning has shown promise in this regard, but each model can only extract a limited number of image features for classification. To overcome this limitation and improve classification performance, this study proposes ensemble models that combine the decisions of several deep learning models. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models, we tested their performance on the publicly available gastric cancer dataset, Gastric Histopathology Sub-size Image Database. Our experimental results showed that the top 5 ensemble model achieved state-of-the-art detection accuracy in all sub-databases, with the highest detection accuracy of 99.20% in the 160 x 160 pixels sub-database. These results demonstrated that ensemble models could extract important features from smaller patch sizes and achieve promising performance.

To further investigate the clinical significance of this phenomenon, we performed Illumina 850K methylation microarray analysis in AGS gastric cancer cells, and cells depleted of STAT3. Integrative computational analysis identified SPG20 as a putative STAT3 epigenetic target, showing promoter hypomethylation in STAT3-depleted AGS cells. Bisulphite pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR confirmed that SPG20 is epigenetically silenced by promoter hypermethylation in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines including AGS cells, but not in immortalized gastric epithelial GES cells. Expression of SPG20 could be restored by the treatment with a DNMT inhibitor, further suggesting that SPG20 is epigenetically silenced by promoter methylation. Clinically, a progressive increase in SPG20 methylation was observed in tissues samples from gastritis (n = 34), to intestinal metaplasia (IM, n = 33), to gastric cancer (n = 53). Importantly, SPG20 methylation could be detected in cell-free DNA isolated from serum samples of gastritis, IM and gastric cancer patients, having a progressive similar to tissues.

Moreover, the imaging techniques currently used for gastric cancer screening, such as computed tomography and barium examination, are usually radioactive and have low sensitivity and specificity. Even though endoscopy has high accuracy for gastric cancer screening, its application is limited by the invasiveness of the technique. Breath analysis is an economic, effective, easy to perform, non-invasive detection method, and has no undesirable side effects on subjects.

Meanwhile, the lack of an intraoperative technique for the real-time evaluation of early gastric cancer is also a serious problem.

This instrument has a compact structure with a maximum outer diameter of 3 mm and an insertion length of 1220 mm. It has 5 DOFs with a dual-bending function, which can form a surgical operation triangulation to easily perform the endoscopic procedure. Apart from the surgical forceps, the end of the instrument can be equipped with different endoscopic devices to meet the needs of diagnosis and treatment, such as endomicroscopic probes, electrosurgical knives, and laser ablation optical fibers.

Most of the cases in the Western world are diagnosed at late stages when the treatment is largely ineffective. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a well-established carcinogen for gastric cancer. While lifestyle factors are important, the efficacy of interventions in their modification, as in the use of antioxidant supplements, is unconvincing. No organized screening programs can be found outside Asia (Japan and South Korea). Although several screening approaches have been proposed, including indirect atrophy detection by measuring pepsinogen in the circulation, none of them have so far been implemented, and more study data is required to justify any implementation. Mass eradication of H. pylori in high-risk areas tends to be cost-effective, but its adverse effects and resistance remain a concern. Searches for new screening biomarkers, including microRNA and cancer-autoantibody panels, as well as detection of volatile organic compounds in the breath, are in progress. Endoscopy with a proper biopsy follow-up remains the standard for early detection of cancer and related premalignant lesions. At the same time, new advanced high-resolution endoscopic technologies are showing promising results with respect to diagnosing mucosal lesions visually and targeting each biopsy. New histological risk stratifications (classifications), including OLGA and OLGIM, have recently been developed.

So far the value of conventional tumour markers such as Ca72-4 or carcinoembryonic antigen is limited, and even markers developed from molecular biological studies on the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer, such as E-cadherin and others, have not proved to be of adequate sensitivity and specificity to allow the early detection of gastric cancer. With the development of innovative diagnostic tools, such as proteome analysis, new biomarkers may be identified that may allow early diagnosis and thus screening for gastric cancer, particularly in at-risk patient populations.

Blood-based biomarker assays for the detection of early-stage GC could be of great relevance both for the risk group or for population-wide based screening programs, The currently used tumor marker assays for detecting GC are simple and rapid, but their use is limited by their low sensitivity and specificity.

The ability to accurately predict the development of GC and start treatment on time, as well as the ability to determine the stage of the disease if the diagnosis is confirmed - non-invasive biomarkers can become the key to solving these and many other problems of modern medicine.

In addition, they are quite specific and stable due to their carriers (extracellular vesicles or Argonaute 2 protein) and can be detected in various human biological fluids, in particular gastric juice.

The population for this study was 22 913 618 individuals aged =40 years who had been invited to participate in a GC screening program from 2005 to 2006. We determined whether these individuals had attended the GC screening program and which method an upper gastrointestinal series (UGIS) or endoscopythey underwent. We followed the participants to determine whether they had a second GC screening after 2 years. The overall participation rate in the GC screening was 20.5%. More people underwent UGIS than endoscopy. Individuals who had been screened by endoscopy rather than UGIS were more likely to be younger, male, or those who were National Health Insurance (NHI) beneficiaries with a higher premium rate. Of those who underwent baseline screening, 59.4% participated in a rescreening program 2 years later. NHI beneficiaries with a higher premium rate were significantly more likely to be rescreened than medical aid recipients.

Infection with Helicobacter pylori is responsible for over 70% of GC incidence; colonization induces chronic inflammation, which can facilitate progression to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and GC (Correa pathway). Although H. pylori eradication is a necessary first step in GC prevention, some patients continue to progress to advanced stage disease if substantial tissue damage has occurred or inflammation persists. This progression is often asymptomatic until cancer reaches stage IV, yet efficient, cost-effective screening protocols for patients who present with early stages of the Correa pathway do not exist. Given the high interpatient heterogeneity in progression time through this pathway, such screening protocols must necessarily be personalized. This requires the identification of reliable and longitudinally assessable biomarkers of patient-specific progression. Several gastric stem cell (GSC) markers including CD44, CD133, and Lgr5 are up-regulated in GC. Here we show a significant stepwise increase in immunohistochemical staining for these markers in biopsies at different stages of the Correa pathway, suggesting GSC fraction to be a promising candidate biomarker for early detection of malignant transformation. We present a mathematical model capable of both simulating clinically observed increases in GSC fraction in longitudinal biopsy samples of individual patients, and forecasting patient-specific disease progression trajectories based only on characteristics identified from immunohistochemistry at initial presentation. From these forecasts, personalized screening schedules may be identified that would allow early stratification of high-risk patients, and potentially earlier detection of dysplasia or early-stage GC.",Apr-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,270-277,,4,27,,Appl.

However, tools for the early detection of gastric cancer are still lacking. Isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomic assays were conducted to identify and quantify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the gastric mucosal tissues of GC patients at different stages. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the pathways enriched among the DEPs and candidate marker proteins. The expression levels and distribution of candidate proteins were confirmed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. In this study, by using the iTRAQ quantitative proteomic strategy, we identified 727 and 502 DEPs that were upregulated in EGC vs. PGC and EGC vs. NGC, respectively. These DEPs were mainly involved in the innate immune response and RNA binding. PRTN3 was identified as a marker of early gastric cancer by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the PRM assay confirmed the significant overexpression of PRTN3 in EGC gastric mucosa compared to PGC and NGC mucosa. Our data demonstrated that PRTN3 in the gastric mucosa could be used as a novel biomarker to identify patients with early gastric cancer via endoscopy.Significance: Gastric cancer remains one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and has a high mortality rate. Patients with progressive gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer have a poor prognosis, with a 5-year relative survival rate of 6%. Therefore, early detection and diagnosis of gastric cancer is a key step toward improving the survival rate.The present study identified PRTN3 as a marker of early gastric cancer by an iTRAQ quantitative proteomic strategy.

Zic1 is a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene that is epigenetically silenced in GC. In this study, we investigated Zic1 promoter methylation in plasma DNA as a novel molecular marker for the early diagnosis and monitoring of GC. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) assay was performed to detect Zic1 promoter methylation in plasma DNA from 20 healthy subjects, 50 gastric intraepithelial neoplasia patients, and 104 GC patients. The Zic1 promoter methylation rate in the plasma samples from the healthy control group was 0%, but it reached 54.0% in the intraepithelial neoplasia group and 60.6% in the GC group. The latter two values were significantly higher than that found in the healthy control group (p < 0.05), with a 100% specificity for intraepithelial neoplasia and GC diagnosis. The positive predictive value of plasma Zic1 promoter methylation for the diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasia and GC was 100%. Methylation status in the GC group was not significantly associated with tumor size, tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, TNM staging, or tumor invasion (p > 0.05). Assessment of the significance of detection of the carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) level and Zic1 promoter methylation rate for GC diagnosis revealed that the sensitivity of Zic1 promoter methylation was significantly higher than that of the CEA level as a marker and that the combined measurement of these two indices (parallel testing) improved sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that the Zic1 promoter methylation rate in plasma-derived DNA is of great significance for the early screening of GC and monitoring of tumorigenesis. Zic1 promoter methylation may serve as a novel non-invasive plasma biomarker for the early detection of GC and for risk assessment in high-risk populations. The combined measurement of the Zic1 promoter methylation rate and CEA level (parallel testing) may enhance the current guidelines for the early diagnosis of GC.",2015/7/24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:14,,e0133906,,7,10,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000358622000172,,,,SERUM; MARKERS; ABERRANT METHYLATION; POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; GENE-EXPRESSION; 994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exosomal miRNAs are considered promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics and further validation, we identified and evaluated exosomal miRNAs in serum as early diagnostic markers for GC. NGS revealed that the average mappable reads in the RNA libraries were about 6.5 million per patient including miRNAs (73.38%), rRNAs (17.10%), snRNAs (8.83%), snoRNAs (0.65%), and tRNAs (0.04%). A total of 66 up and 13 down-regulated exosomal miRNAs were found in the screened cohort. In the validation cohort, by comparing with healthy individuals, higher levels of serum exosomal miR-92b-3p, let-7g-5p, miR-146b-5p, and miR-9-5p were found to be significantly associated with early-stage GC (p < 0.05). Diagnostic power of the combined panels of the exosomal miRNAs or the combination of exosomal miRNAs and CEA outperformed that of single exosomal miRNA marker for establishing a diagnosis of early-stage GC. The combined diagnosis of exosomal miR-92b-3p + let-7g-5p + miR-146b-5p + miR-9-5p with CEA had the most powerful efficiency with an AUC up to 0.786. In addition, serum levels of exosomal miR-92b-3p were significantly associated with poor cohesiveness (p = 0.0021), let-7g-5p and miR-146b-5p were significantly correlated with nerve infiltration (p = 0.0234 and p = 0.0126, respectively), and miR146b-5p was statistically correlated with tumor invasion depth in early-stage GC (p = 0.0089).

It is mainly classified into well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1), moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (tub2), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (por), signet-ring cell carcinoma (sig), mucinous adenocarcinoma (muc), and papillary adenocarcinoma (pap). By screening, we found cathepsin E (CTSE) expresses universally in sig-type, occasionally in por-type, and rarely in tub1/tub2-type GC cell lines. In surgically-resected specimens, CTSE was immunostained in 50/51 sig-type (98.0%), 3/10 tub1-type (30.0%), 7/18 tub2-type (38.9%), 15/26 por-type (57.7%), 4/10 pap-type (40.0%), and 0/3 muc-type (0.0%) GC.

For non-malignant tissues, CTSE is universally expressed in normal fundic, pyloric, and cardiac glands of stomach, but hardly in other digestive organs. In the precancerous intestinal metaplasia of stomach, CTSE is mostly observed in mixed gastric-and-intestinal type and deficient in solely-intestinal type. CTSE expression is positively correlated with gastric marker MUC5AC (p<0.0001) and negatively correlated with intestinal marker MUC2 (p = 0.0019). For sig-type GC, in both tumors and background mucosa, expression of MUC5AC and CTSE is high whereas that of MUC2 is low, indicating that sig-type GC reflects the features of background mucosa. For gastric adenoma and tub1/tub2-type GC, more undifferentiated tumors tend to show higher expression of CTSE with MUC5AC and lower expression of MUC2 in tumors, but they tend to present lower expression of CTSE, MUC5AC and MUC2 in background mucosa. These suggest that more malignant gastric adenocarcinoma with stronger gastric and weaker intestinal properties tend to arise from background mucosa with decreased both gastric and intestinal features.

Currently, exosomebased liquid biopsy has been applied in diagnosis and monitoring of diseases including cancers, whereas disease detection based on exosomes at the metabolic level is rarely reported. Herein, the specific aptamer-coupled Au-decorated polymorphic carbon (CoMPC@Au-Apt) is constructed for the capture of urinary exosomes from early GC patients and healthy controls (HCs) and the subsequent exosome metabolic pattern profiling without extra elution process. Combining with machine learning algorithm on all exosome metabolic patterns, the early GC patients are excellently discriminated from HCs, with an accuracy of 100% for both the discovery set and blind test.

Although the incidence of GC is declining, the outcomes for GC patients remain dismal because of the lack of effective biomarkers to detect early GC and predict both recurrence and chemosensitivity. Current tumor markers for GC, including serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, are not ideal due to their relatively low sensitivity and specificity. Recent improvements in molecular techniques are better able to identify aberrant expression of GC-related molecules, including oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, and DNA methylation, as novel molecular markers, although the molecular pathogenesis of GC is complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Detection of genetic and epigenetic alterations from gastric tissue or blood samples has diagnostic value in the management of GC. There are high expectations for molecular markers that can be used as new screening tools for early detection of GC as well as for patient stratification towards personalized treatment of GC through prediction of prognosis and drug-sensitivity.

Due to the lack of early symptoms, GC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when treatment options are limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers for early detection, prognosis evaluation, and targeted treatment of GC. Studies have shown that Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 1 (SKAP1) promotes cell proliferation and invasion and is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and breast cancer. However, the role and mechanism of SKAP1 in GC are unclear. Here, analyses of multiple databases and experiments revealed that SKAP1 expression was higher in GC than in adjacent normal tissues. The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that high SKAP1 expression was associated with poor GC prognosis. SKAP1 expression was higher in GC than in normal gastric epithelial cells. SKAP1 silencing reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of the GC cell lines MKN45 and HGC27. Rescue experiments suggest that SKAP1 may promote GC progression by activating JAK1/PI3K/AKT signaling and regulating GC cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and other functions. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SKAP1 was associated with immune cell infiltration and checkpoint expression in GC. High SKAP1 expression was associated with poorer immunotherapy outcomes, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker of GC immunotherapy efficacy. In summary, SKAP1 is overexpressed in GC, where it promotes cell proliferation, invasion and migration and is associated with poor prognosis and poor immunotherapy outcomes.

Nevertheless, because GC screening programs are not cost-effective, most patients receive diagnosis in the advanced stages, when surgical options are limited. Peritoneal dissemination occurs in approximately one-third of patients with GC at the diagnosis and is a strong predictor of poor outcome. Despite the clinical relevance, biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of peritoneal metastasis in GC remain poorly defined. Here, we report results of a high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome expression in paired samples of non-neoplastic and neoplastic gastric samples from 31 patients with GC with or without peritoneal carcinomatosis. The RNA-seq analysis led to the discovery of a group of highly upregulated or downregulated genes, including the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and one cut domain family member 2 (ONECUT2) that were differentially modulated in patients with peritoneal disease in comparison with patients without peritoneal involvement. Both LIFR and ONECUT2 predicted survival at univariate statistical analysis. LIFR and its major ligand LIF belong to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family and have a central role in immune system regulation, carcinogenesis, and dissemination in several human cancers. To confirm the mechanistic role of the LIF/LIFR pathway in promoting GC progression, GC cell lines were challenged in vitro with LIF and a LIFR inhibitor. Among several GC cell lines, MKN45 cells displayed the higher expression of the receptor, and their exposure to LIF promotes a concentration-dependent proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as shown by modulation of relative expression of E-cadherin/vimentin along with JAK and STAT3 phosphorylation and acquisition of a migratory phenotype. Furthermore, exposure to LIF promoted the adhesion of MKN45 cells to the peritoneum in an ex vivo assay. These effects were reversed by the pharmacological blockade of LIFR signaling. Together, these data suggest that LIFR might have a major role in promoting disease progression and peritoneal dissemination in patients with GC and that development of LIF/LIFR inhibitors might have a role in the treatment of GC.",2022/6/30,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,939969,,939969,12,,Front.

Identifying circulating biomarkers is helpful to improve theranostics of gastric cancer. Herein, we are for the first time to report miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p were identified to be the novel potential plasma biomarkers to detect gastric cancer. Differentially expressed miRNAs were initially screened out by genome-wide miRNA profiling microarrays between 16 plasma samples of gastric cancer and 18 matched normal controls, and then were quantified and validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method between 155 gastric cancer cases and 111 normal controls. Additionally, 30 plasma samples from precancerous lesions and 18 paired samples from gastric cancer patients with gastrectomy were further detected. Results showed that based on two normalization methods, miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p in plasma were found to be capable of distinguishing normal population from GC cases with different TNM stages and differentiation grades, particularly including the early cancer cases (P<0.05). And the two miRNAs were down-regulated in GC cases (FC<0.5). Especially, the down-regulation degree was correlated with the progression of the GC cases from the early stage to the advanced stage (0.2<rs<0.3, P<0.01). And the same weak down-regulation of the two biomarkers as the early GC occurred initially in the precancerous diseases (P<0.05). The corresponding performance of the two miRNAs to detect GC in ROC analysis gradually performed better with the disease progression from the earlier stages or lower grades to the advanced stages (TNM. stage: AUC=0.832 for miR-16-5p; TNM III stage: AUC=0.822 for miR-19b-3p) or high grade (Poorly differentiated: AUC=0.801, 0.791 respectively for miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p). Additionally, miR-19b-3p remained down-regulated in patient plasma within 9 days after gastrectomy.

A total of 305 cases of diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma were enrolled, microRNAs (miRNAs) and their transcriptome sequencing data were obtained from the ""The Cancer Genome Atlas."" Blood samples were collected from GC patients before surgery and therapy. The miRNA levels and the expression of RNA were detected by real-time RT-PCR. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers. The combining predictors were established with the logistic regression analysis. Hundreds of miRNA were with higher area under curve (AUC) than 0.5; among them, nine miRNAs were with the highest AUC more than 0.90 and displayed strong diagnostic value. Moreover, the mir-17 level was correlated with tumor stage (p = 0.029), while mir-133b, mir-133a-2, and mir-1-2 levels were significantly correlated with race, tumor pathologic, and tumor stage (p < 0.05).

Perioperative chemotherapy plays an important role in the management and treatment of advanced stage disease. However, response to chemotherapy varies widely, with some patients presenting no or only minor response to treatment. Hence, chemotherapy resistance is a major clinical problem that impacts on outcome. Unfortunately, to date there are no reliable biomarkers available that predict response to chemotherapy before the start of the treatment, or that allow modification of chemotherapy resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) could provide an answer to this problem. miRNAs are involved in the initiation and progression of a variety of cancer types, and there is evidence that miRNAs impact on resistance towards chemotherapeutic drugs as well. This current review aims to provide an overview about the potential clinical applicability of miRNAs as biomarkers for chemoresistance in GC.

Multiple possibilities for miRNA secretion have been elucidated, including active secretion by microvesicles, exosomes, apoptotic bodies, high-density lipoproteins and protein complexes as well as passive leakage from cells. However, the mechanism underlying lncRNA secretion and the functions of circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs have not been fully illuminated. Concurrently, to standardize results of global investigations of circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs biomarker studies, several recommendations for pre-analytic considerations are put forward.

In our previous study, a novel and sensitive method for quantifying cell-free DNA (CFD) in human blood was established and tested for its ability to predict patients with tumor. We want to investigate CFD expression in the sera of GC patients in an attempt to explore the clinical significance of CFD in improving the early screening of GC and monitoring GC progression by the branched DNA (bDNA)-based Alu assay. The concentration of CFD was quantitated by bDNA-based Alu assay. CEA, CA19-9, C72-4 and CA50 concentrations were determined by ABBOTT ARCHITECT I2000 SR. We found the CFD concentrations have significant differences between GC patients, benign gastric disease (BGD) patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05). CFD were weakly correlated with CEA (r = -0.197, P < 0.05) or CA50 (r = 0.206, P < 0.05), and no correlation with CA19-9 (r = -0.061, P > 0.05) or CA72-4 (r = 0.011, P > 0.05). In addition, CFD concentrations were significantly higher in stage I GC patients than BGD patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in CEA, CA19-9 and CA50 among the three traditional tumor markers (P > 0.05). Our analysis showed that CFD was more sensitive than CEA, CA19-9, CA72-4 or CA50 in early screening of GC.

Currently, screening tests for GC are not cost-effective or have low accuracy. Previously, we described an extended phenotype of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs; CD24+CD44+CD54+EpCAM+) that is associated with metastasis and tumor stage in GC patients. The goal of the current research is to evaluate the presence of these GCSCs in the peripheral blood of GC patients and healthy volunteers. A total of 73 blood samples were collected from 32 GC patients and 41 healthy volunteers. After peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) extraction, multiparametric flow cytometry was performed looking for GCSCs. Using clustering data through artificial intelligence (AI), we defined high/low levels of circulating GCSCs (cGCSCs) and proceeded to evaluate its association with clinical and prognostic variables. Finally, a diagnostic test analysis was performed evaluating patients and healthy volunteers. We found that cGCSCs are present in most GC patients with a mean concentration of 0.48%. The AI clustering showed two groups with different cGCSC levels and clinical characteristics. Through statistical analysis, we confirmed the association between cGCSC levels and lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and overall survival. The diagnostic test analysis showed sensibility, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 83%, 95%, and 0.911, respectively.

Its overexpression in cancer is associated with immune evasion, metastasis, poor prognosis, and lower overall survival. We evaluate the plasma levels of soluble HLA-G, (sHLA-G) in patients with GC and benign gastric pathologies using an ELISA test. A higher concentration of sHLA-G in patients with GC than in those with benign pathologies, higher levels of plasma sHLA-G in women with GC compared with men and significant differences in the sHLA-G levels between the benign gastric pathologies evaluated, was our main findings. As no significant differences were found between the GC assessed stages in our study population, we suggest that sHLA-G is not an adequate marker for staging GC, but it does have diagnostic potential.

This study aimed to identify the metabolic differences between intestinal metaplasia (IM) and GC to determine the pathways involved in GC. A metabolic analysis of IM and tissue samples from 37 patients with GC was conducted using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Overall, 665 and 278 significant features were identified in the aqueous and 278 organic phases, respectively, using false discovery rate analysis, which controls the expected proportion of false positives among the significant results. sPLS-DA revealed a clear separation between IM and GC samples. Steroid hormone biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism, purine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism were the most significantly altered pathways. The intensity of 11 metabolites, including N1, N2-diacetylspermine, creatine riboside, and N-formylkynurenine, showed significant elevation in more advanced GC. Based on pathway enrichment analysis and cancer stage-specific alterations, we identified six potential candidates as diagnostic biomarkers: aldosterone, N-formylkynurenine, guanosine triphosphate, arginine, S-adenosylmethioninamine, and creatine riboside.

GC is characterized as an aggressive malignancy which is very tough to be detected at an early stage. GC has been defined as a complex, multistep process involving multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to aberrant expression of key regulating factors. GC according to WHO has been defined as malignant epithelial tumors of the gastric mucosa with glandular differentiation. About one half of the GCs are located in the lower stomach, and remaining is located in the corpus and fundus of the stomach (20%), lesser curvature (20%), cardia (10%) and greater curvature (3%). GC has been classified into intestinal and diffuse types based on epidemiological and clinico-and histopathological features. The etiology of GC is multifactorial and includes dietary as well as non-dietary factors. Despite a lot of research efforts, GC remains to be the cancer without clear symptoms at onset, poor prognosis, with metastasis and recurrence. Thus, there is an urgent need for identifying novel and diagnostic GC biomarkers and techniques with high sensitivity and specificity.

In general, survival' of patients with GC is poor mainly due to advanced-stage diagnosis. Early-stage GC can be cured by endoscopic resection or less invasive surgical treatment. Unfortunately, there is no appropriate screening strategy available for global application. This article provides a description of established national and regional GC screening programs and the screening modalities used. This review also summarizes current approaches to develop cancer-screening biomarkers. Although candidates with initial promising results have been suggested, moving discovery into clinical practice is still a major challenge. Well-designed biomarker studies, with systematic validation steps, are needed to decrease the burden of this fatal disease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Helicobacter pylori infection has been clearly correlated with gastric carcinogenesis. At present and in the near future, the most important challenge is and will be the significant reduction of mortality due to GC. That goal can be achieved through the identification of higher-risk patients, such as those with atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. In this review we intend to discuss the importance of diagnosing H. pylori infection and chronic atrophic gastritis in preventing gastric cancer, using a new non-invasive test called GastroPanel. This test is a classification algorithm including four biochemical parameters pepsinogen I and II (PGI and PGII), gastrin-17 (G17), and anti-Helicobacter pylori antibodies (Ig G anti-Hp) measured in fasting sera, which allows to classify patients as having atrophic or non-atrophic gastritis and to find whether gastritis is associated or not with H. pylori infection. GastroPanel is not a ""cancer test"", but it can and should be used in the screening and diagnosis of subjects with a high cancer risk; still, a careful diagnostic made by superior digestive endoscopy is compulsory to find possible precancerous or cancerous lesions at an early and curable stage.",2016,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:07,,,,3,54,,Rom.

In this study, a total of 37 differentially expressed genes were identified in GC by analyzing TCGA, GSE118897, GSE19826, and GSE54129. Using the PPI database, we identified 17 hub genes in GC. By analyzing the expression of hub genes and OS, MFAP2, BGN, and TREM1 were related to the prognosis of GC. In addition, our results showed that higher levels of BGN exhibited a significant correlation with shorter OS time in GC. Nomogram analysis showed that the dysregulation of BGN could predict the prognosis of GC. Moreover, we revealed that BGN had a markedly negative correlation with B cells but had positive correlations with CD8(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in GC samples. The pan-cancer analysis demonstrated that BGN was differentially expressed and related to tumor-infiltrating immune cells across human cancers.

The symptoms of GC are complex and hard to detect, which also contribute to the poor prognosis of GC. Besides, the current diagnosis forGCis expensive and invasive. Thus, a fast, noninvasive biomarker is urgently needed for GC screening. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, which are involved in a great variety of pathological processes, particularly carcinogenesis. MiRNAs are stable in gastric juice, plasma as well as serum, which facilitate it to be a promising biomarker for cancer. In this study, we selected three novel miRNAs, i.e., miR-233, miR-16, and miR-100, to investigate their potential diagnostic value in GC screening. A total of 50 GCpatients and 47 healthy controlswere involved in this study. Blood serum samples were collected; RNAswere extracted and normalized with U6 snRNA as the internal control; qRT-PCR was performed for relative expression of target miRNAs. Levels of miRNAs expression were compared by Student's t test for the comparison between two groups, and one-way ANOVAwas used for multiple comparisons. The expression of miR-223, miR-16, and miR-100 was all significantly higher in GC patients than controls (all P < 0.001). All the tested miRNAs were manifested to be valuable biomarkers for GC. Relative expression of these miRNAs was significantly correlated with clinical characteristics of GC patients, such as TNM stage (P = 0.036 for miR-223; P < 0.001 for miR-100), metastatic status (P = 0.045 for miR-223; P = 0.031 for miR-16; P = 0.006 for miR-100), tumor size (P = 0.042 for miR-223; P = 0.031 for miR-16; P < 0.001 for miR-100), and differentiation grade (P = 0.036 for miR-223; P = 0.030 for miR16; P = 0.034 for miR-100). However, in T classification, which considered both tumor size and direct extent of primary tumor, the difference in target miRNAs expression was not significant. In summary, we confirmed the diagnostic value of serum miR-223, miR-16, and miR-100 in GC.

The results exhibited the fact that CCAT1 was expressed higher in 57 GC tissue samples than in 57 paired adjacent normal tissue samples. The expression of CCAT1 was also increased in GC cell lines (MKN45, Hs746T, and SGC-7901) compared with the gastric epithelial cell line GES-1. Besides this, decreased cell proliferation with increased cell apoptosis was detected in SGC-7902 cells transfected with CCAT1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). At the same time, a lower cell invasion ability was measured in SCG-7901 cells transfected with CCAT1 shRNA.In addition, miR-219-1 was predicted and convinced a direct target of CCAT1. The expression of miR-219-1 was decreased in GC tissues and GC cell lines. Further studies demonstrated that the roles of CCAT1 in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were inhibited by miR-219-1. Finally, in vivo experiment indicated that tumor growth of GC was suppressed through knockdown of CCAT1.

To reduce its high mortality, sensitive and specific biomarkers for early detection are urgently needed. Recent studies have reported that tumor-specific long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) seem to be potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In the present study, lncRNA and mRNA expression profiling of GC specimens and their paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues was performed. Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified through microarray analysis. The function of differential mRNA was determined by gene ontology and pathway analysis and the functions of lncRNAs were studied by constructing a co-expression network to find the relationships with corresponding mRNAs. We connected the co-expression network, mRNA functions, and the results of the microarray profile differential expression and selected 14 significantly differentially expressed key lncRNAs and 21 key mRNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to verify these key RNAs in 50 newly diagnosed GC patients. The data showed that RP5-919F19, CTD-2541M15 and UCA1 was significantly higher expressed. AP000459, LOC101928316, RP11-167N4 and LINC01071 expression was significantly lower in 30 advanced GC tumor tissues than adjacent non-tumor tissues P<0.05. Then, we further validated the above significant differential expression candidate lncRNAs in 20 early stage GC patients. Results showed that CTD-2541M15 and UCA1 were significantly higher expressed, AP000459, LINC01071 and MEG3 expression was significantly lower in 20 early stage GC patient tumor tissues than adjacent non-tumor tissues (P<0.05). In addition, expression of these lncRNAs shows gradual upward trend from early stage GC to advanced GC. Furthermore, conditional logistic regression analysis revealed the aberrant expression of CTD-2541M15, UCA1 and MEG3 closely linked with GC. There is a set of differentially expressed lncRNAs in GC which may be associated with the progression and development of GC.

The aim of this study was to investigate the DNA methylation status of the ring finger protein 180 (RNF180), secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) genes in the plasma samples of 57 GC patients and 42 control individuals with no malignant disease, and to evaluate the clinical utility of these makers. A significantly higher level of methylation was observed in the plasma DNA of GC patients when compared with that of controls for the three genes investigated (RNF180, 57.89% vs. 23.81%; DAPK1, 49.12% vs. 28.57%; and SFRP2, 71.93% vs. 42.86%).

Notably, RNF180 methylation was found to positively correlate with tumor size (P=0.018), histological type (P=0.025), TNM stage (P=0.002), lymph node metastasis (P=0.008) and distant metastasis (P=0.018). Overall, 50 cancer patients (87.72%) exhibited methylation of at least one of the three markers, while 26 normal subjects presented methylation in plasma DNA [specificity, 38.1%; odds ratio (OR), 4.4]. The combined use of RNF180 and SFRP2 as methylation markers appeared to be the most preferable predictor with regard to predictive power and cost-performance (OR, 5.57; P=0.0002).

Accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions for GC rely heavily on human experts' careful judgments on medical images. However, the improvement of the accuracy is hindered by imaging conditions, limited experience, objective criteria, and inter-observer discrepancies. Recently, the developments of machine learning, especially deep-learning algorithms, have been facilitating computers to extract more information from data automatically. Researchers are exploring the far-reaching applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in various clinical practices, including GC. Herein, we aim to provide a broad framework to summarize current research on AI in GC. In the screening of GC, AI can identify precancerous diseases and assist in early cancer detection with endoscopic examination and pathological confirmation. In the diagnosis of GC, AI can support tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging and subtype classification. For treatment decisions, AI can help with surgical margin determination and prognosis prediction. Meanwhile, current approaches are challenged by data scarcity and poor interpretability.

The role of long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) in the gastric cancer pathogenesis is largely unknown. The present study is aimed to identify aberrantly expressed lncRNAs involved in the progression of GC. 33 IncRNAs showed significantly differential expression levels between gastric tumor samples and matched normal tissues from 5 pairs of samples using microarray assay. LncRNAs were classified into different subgroups. The expression levels of 4 lncRNAs: HIFIA-AS1, PVT1, CBR3-AS1 and UCA1 both in tumor and plasma were further confirmed in 20 gastric patients by real-time PCR assay. Then, the correlations between the tissue and plasma of these 4 IncRNA levels were assessed. Our data show that there was a significantly positive correlation of UCA1 expression levels between tumor tissues and plasma (r = 0.931). Furthermore, the specificity and sensitivity of PVT-1 and UCA1 were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results demonstrated that plasma UCA1 provided the higher diagnostic performance for detection of GC (AUC = 0.928; P < 0.001) than PVT-1 (AUC = 0.731; P < 0.01).

The cathepsin F (CTSF) gene has recently been found to participate in the progression of several types of cancer. However, the clinical characteristics and function of CTSF in GC as well as its molecular mechanisms are not clear. Six GC cell lines and 44 paired adjacent noncancerous and GC tissue samples were used to assess CTSF expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We used lentivirus-mediated small hairpin RNA (Lenti-shRNA) against CTSF to knock down the expression of CTSF in GC cells. Western blot and qPCR were used to analyze the mRNA and related protein expression. The biological phenotypes of gastric cells were examined by cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Microarray-based mRNA expression profile screening was also performed to evaluate the potential molecular pathways in which CTSF may be involved. The CTSF mRNA level was associated with tumor differentiation, depth of tumor invasion, and lymph node metastasis. Downregulation of CTSF expression efficiently inhibited apoptosis and promoted the proliferation of GC cells. Moreover, a total of 1,117 upregulated mRNAs and 1,143 downregulated mRNAs were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Further analysis identified the involvement of these mRNAs in cancer-related pathways and various other biological processes. Nine DEGs in cancer-related pathways and three downstream genes in the apoptosis pathway were validated by Western blot, which was mainly in agreement with the microarray data. To our knowledge, this is the first report investigating the effect of CTSF on the growth and apoptosis in GC cells and its clinical significance. The CTSF gene may function as a tumor suppressor in GC and may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of GC.",2018,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,83-93,,1,26,,Oncol.

Based on data from 2951 samples, 58 routine blood biochemical indices, age and gender were collected as comprehensive indices to establish the identification model. Then, the number of indices was reduced to simplify the model, and 33 indices were utilized to build the final identification tool.

The prognosis for patients with late stage GC receiving the standard of care treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, remains poor. Developing novel treatment strategies, identifying new molecules for targeted therapy, and devising screening techniques to detect this cancer in its early stages are needed for GC patients. The discovery of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), primarily microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), helped to elucidate the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, diagnosis and treatment of GC. Recently, significant research has been conducted on non-coding RNAs and how the regulatory dysfunction of these RNAs impacts the tumorigenesis of GC. In this study, we review papers published in the last five years concerning the dysregulation of non-coding RNAs, especially miRNAs and lncRNAs, in GC. We summarize instances of aberrant expression of the ncRNAs in GC and their effect on survival-related events, including cell cycle regulation, AKT signaling, apoptosis and drug resistance. Additionally, we evaluate how ncRNA dysregulation affects the metastatic process, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stem cells, transcription factor activity, and oncogene and tumor suppressor expression. Lastly, we determine how ncRNAs affect angiogenesis in the microenvironment of GC. We further discuss the use of ncRNAs as potential biomarkers for use in clinical screening, early diagnosis and prognosis of GC.

The key for improving the survival rate lies in reliable screening and early diagnosis. Existing techniques including barium-meal gastric photofluorography and upper endoscopy can be costly and time-consuming and are thus impractical for population screening. We look instead for small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, currently also referred as exosomes) sized ? 30-150 nm as a candidate. sEVs have attracted a significantly higher level of attention during the past decade or two because of their potentials in disease diagnoses and therapeutics. Here, we report that the composition information of the collective Raman-active bonds inside sEVs of human donors obtained by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) holds the potential for non-invasive GC detection. SERS was triggered by the substrate of gold nanopyramid arrays we developed previously. A machine learning-based spectral feature analysis algorithm was developed for objectively distinguishing the cancer derived sEVs from those of the non-cancer sub-population. sEVs from the tissue, blood, and saliva of GC patients and non-GC participants were collected (n = 15 each) and analyzed.

Furthermore, DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic alteration, and many innovative methods have been developed to quantify it rapidly and accurately. Nonetheless, large-scale clinical validation of DNA methylation serving as tumor biomarkers is still lacking, precluding their implementation in clinical practice.

It requires major attention in terms of early detection and proper diagnosis. Endoscopy and analysis of endoscopic images is the most common detection method of GC in the early stage. However, specialised professionals are required for endoscopy. This becomes a bottleneck for patients in remote areas and is a major cause of late diagnosis. Hence, there is a need for an efficient, cost-effective user-friendly tool that can identify GC with optimal accuracy and less effort. Recently, Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool that can enhance precision and accuracy in diagnosis, treatment and patient care. In this paper, a deep learning-based strategy has been presented as a possibility of identifying GC at early stage. For this purpose, clinical parameters, like, complete blood count (CBC) and endoscopic images were correlated to delineate cancerous and non-cancerous ulceration in GI tract. For this preliminary study, GC related kaggle-based open-source data bank has been used to develop various pilot algorithms. A PyCharm based interface has been developed to identify the changes in CBC parameters. If these parameters are beyond a pre-defined cut-off, then the corresponding endoscopic images are analysed. A couple of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based pre-trained models, like, VGG16 and NasNetMobile have been developed on these images. A comparative analysis has been performed to determine the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity and run-time. The algorithms developed provide proof of evidences that deep learning networks can be used to identify GC accurately and sensitively and further can distinguish GC from non-malignant tissues. Thus, there is a potential role of deep learning algorithms in GC diagnosis, segmentation as well as classifications. Integrating CNNs into gastric cancer detection leverages advanced image analysis. Metrology ensures the accuracy of measurements used in the diagnostic process, enhancing the reliability of CNN-based models. This synergy aims to improve the precision of gastric cancer detection by combining sophisticated deep learning tools with precise metrological data, contributing to more accurate and reproducible diagnostic outcomes in the field of medical imaging.",2024,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Place: Meloneras, SPAIN Web of Science ID: WOS:001269451500110",,,,142,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were used to initially evaluate ZNF677 expression and methylation in GC samples. Confirmation was performed on fifty internal samples, including gastric tumors and adjacent normal specimens, using q-MSP and q-PCR methods. Further validations were done using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on human cancers. The obtained results in silico and experimentally illustrated that ZNF677 is significantly hypermethylated and downregulated through gastric tumorigenesis. ZNF677 methylation levels were also correlated with perineural invasion (p = 0.0382) in internal samples. Furthermore, Spearman's correlation analysis showed that ZNF677 methylation is negatively (r = -0.4614, p < 0.0001) correlated with its mRNA expression levels. ROC curve analysis also illustrated the high diagnostic value of ZNF677 methylation for early detection of GC (AUC = 0.8592). Gene set enrichment analysis further revealed that ZNF677 participates in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell proliferation in GC. Moreover, in addition to hypermethylation in other malignancies, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, ZNF677 was hypermethylated in precancerous gastric tissues with intestinal metaplasia, indicating its methylation as a driver event through tumorigenesis.

Expression of miR-1286 was measured by RT-qPCR. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was utilized for measuring GC cell proliferation ability. The migration and invasion abilities of GC cells were measured using Transwell assays. Serum samples were obtained from 108 GC patients, 62 gastritis cases and 62 healthy volunteers. The diagnostic performance of miR-1286 was assessed using ROC analysis, and the predictive value of miR-1286 for peritoneal metastasis onset was analyzed using logistic regression analysis. miR-1286 played as a tumor suppressor in GC progression by inhibiting GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In GC patients, significantly decreased miR-1286 was observed compared to gastritis and healthy controls, and had considerable diagnostic accuracy to distinguish GC from the controls. A significant association was found between miR-1286 expression and HP infection, peritoneal metastasis and TNM stage. Moreover, miR-1286 was lowly expressed in GC patients with peritoneal metastasis, and independently predicted the occurrence of peritoneal metastasis in GC. miR-1286 acts as a tumor suppressor and a biomarker in GC, and is closely associated with HP infection and peritoneal metastasis onset.

Despite the recent decrease in mortality rates, the prognosis remains poor. Therefore, it is necessary to find novel biomarkers with early diagnostic value for GC. In this study, we present a large-scale proteomic analysis of 30 GC tissues and 30 matched healthy tissues using label-free global proteome profiling. Our results identified 537 differentially expressed proteins, including 280 upregulated and 257 downregulated pro -teins. The ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) results indicated that the sirtuin signaling pathway was the most activatedpathway in GC tissueswhereas oxidativephosphorylation was themostinhibited. More -over, the most activated molecular function was cellular movement, including tissue invasion by tumor cell lines. Based on IPA results, 15 hub proteins were screened. Using the receiver operating character-istic curve, most of hub proteins showed a high diagnostic power in distinguishing between tumors and healthy controls. A four-protein (ATP5B-ATP5O-NDUFB4-NDUFB8) diagnostic signature was built using a random forest model. The area under the curve (AUC) values of this model were 0.996 and 0.886 for the training and testing sets, respectively, suggesting that the four-protein signature has a high diag-nostic power.

Aberrant methylation has been demonstrated to be involved in PD-L1 dysregulated expression in human cancers and possesses a great value as a diagnostic biomarker. Given that, in this study, we investigated the methylation status of PD-L1 as a promising biomarker in primary gastric tumors and identified functional CpG loci undergoing aberrant methylation through tumorigenesis of GC. PD-L1 methylation was initially evaluated in-silico using TCGA-STAD dataset. Pearson's correlation analysis was further employed to identify the most significant functional methylated CpG loci of PD-L1 gene in TCGA-STAD patient cohort. Methylation status and its correlation with PD-L1 expression were also validated using q-MSP and qRT-PCR in a set of internal samples, including 25 paired primary gastric tumors and adjacent normal tissues. The obtained results from TCGA-STAD showed that PD-L1 is significantly hypermethylated through gastric tumorigenesis, mostly in two CpG loci overlapping with cg19724470 and cg15837913 probes. Besides, PD-L1 DNA methylation was negatively correlated with PD-L1 expression in tumor samples. Furthermore, hypermethylation of cg19724470 and cg15837913 regions was validated in primary gastric tumors compared to adjacent normal samples. Also, ROC curve analysis illustrated the high diagnostic value of PD-L1 methylation for early detection of GC (AUC = 0.8110).

The International Agency for Research on Cancer has called for Helicobacter pylori test-and-treat strategies in countries with high rates of GC. However, for countries with low rates of GC, such as most Western countries, the balance between benefits, harms and costs of screening is less clear-cut. GC is a disease with a well-characterized precancerous process, providing the basis for primary and secondary prevention efforts.

LncRNAs are a group of non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level. LncRNAs play essential roles in GC initiation and development in the same way as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes. Recent investigations have revealed that LncRNAs are often aberrantly expressed in GC; are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion; and correlate with the malignant phenotype of GC. LncRNAs, especially the lncRNAs present in the blood and gastric juice, show potential value as biomarkers for the diagnosis of GC or for determining disease prognosis. However, there are still many challenges to be faced before LncRNAs can be used in clinical applications. In this review, we summarise lncRNAs as the potential biomarkers for GC and the current challenges associated with the clinical application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Biomarker research is essential to improve the early detection of GC. Technological advances and research methodologies have improved diagnostic tools, identifying several potential biomarkers for GC, including microRNA, DNA methylation markers, and protein-based biomarkers. Although most studies have focused on identifying biomarkers in biofluids, the low specificity of these markers has limited their use in clinical practice. This is because many cancers share similar alterations and biomarkers, so obtaining them from the site of disease origin could yield more specific results. As a result, recent research efforts have shifted towards exploring gastric juice (GJ) as an alternative source for biomarker identification. Since GJ is a waste product during a gastroscopic examination, it could provide a ""liquid biopsy"" enriched with disease-specific biomarkers generated directly at the damaged site. Furthermore, as it contains secretions from the stomach lining, it could reflect changes associated with the developmental stage of GC.

THBS2 was upregulated in gastric cancer tissue compared with normal tissue via analyzing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Additionally, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the level of serum THBS2 and carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, was higher dramatically in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) than that in healthy control (HC) in addition to patients with benign gastric tumor (BGT), which suggested that THBS2 indeed associated with GC. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve assay was conducted to demonstrate that serum THBS2 was similar to CA19-9 to distinguish patients with early gastric cancer from healthy control and patients with benign gastric tumor and that THBS2 combined with CA19-9 improved the detective performance of THBS2 for early gastric cancer. Furthermore, we applied the gene set enrichment analysis assay to analyze signaling pathways related to THBS2. We found that THBS2 positively controlled MAPK and WNT signaling pathways, which indicated that THBS2 might exert its functions via the pathway mentioned above.

Interestingly, the expression levels of EMS1 mRNA and protein in GC cells were inhibited by microRNA-545 (miR-545), which was identified by a bioinformatics analysis. The expression level of miR-545 in carcinoma tissues was significantly lower than that in para-carcinoma tissues. The proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of GC cells were suppressed by exogenous oligonucleotides of miR-545 mimics.

Gastroscopy is an effective screening technique for decreasing mortality. However, there are still limited useful non-invasive markers for early detection of GC. Bile acids are important molecules for the modulation of energy metabolism. With an in-depth targeted method for accurate quantitation of 80 bile acids (BAs), we aimed to find potential biomarkers for the early screening of GC. A cohort with 280 participants was enrolled, including 113 GC, 22 benign gastric lesions (BGL) and 145 healthy controls. Potential markers were identified using a random forest machine algorithm in the discovery cohort (n=180), then validated in an internal validation cohort (n=78) and a group with 22 BGL. The results represented significant alterations in the circulating BA pool between GC and the controls. BAs also exhibited significant correlations with various clinical traits. Then, we developed a diagnostic panel that comprised six BAs or ratios for GC detection. The panel showed high accuracy for the diagnosis of GC with AUC of 1 (95%CI: 1.00-1.00) and 0.98 (95%CI: 0.93-1.00) in the discovery and validation cohort, respectively. This 6-BAs panel was also able to identify early GC with AUC of 1 (95%CI: 0.999-1.00) and 0.94 (95%CI: 0.83-1.00) in the discovery and validation cohort, respectively. Meanwhile, this panel achieved a good differential diagnosis between GC and BGL and the AUC was 0.873 (95%CI: 0.812-0.934).

Outcomes of patients are poor largely due to chemoresistance or recurrence. Thus, identifying novel biomarkers to predict response to therapy and/or prognosis are urgently needed. RAD51B, a key player in DNA repair/recombination, has the potential to be a candidate oncogene and biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, its relationship with GC remains unclear. To evaluate clinicopathological and prognostic significance of RAD51B in GC, we examined messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from 69 and tissue microarray from 144 GC patients, respectively. Our results showed that RAD51BmRNAexpression was significantly up-regulated in tumors compared to that of matched noncancerous tissues (P < 0.001). In parallel, RAD51B protein showed amainly nucleus-staining pattern, and the positive rate in tumors and stomach atypical hyperplasia was significantly higher than that in matched noncancerous tissues (P = 0.015). Moreover, high level of RAD51B protein was correlated with advanced stage (P = 0.009), aggressive differentiation (P = 0.022), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001). Further, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high level of RAD51B expression exhibited worse overall survival compared to patients with low level (P = 0.040). A multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that RAD51B may be an independent prognostic factor for GC patients in Chinese population (P = 0.004). Additionally, functional studies indicated that over-expression of RAD51B promoted cell proliferation, aneuploidy, and drug resistance, while RAD51B knockdown led to G1 arrest and sensitized cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In conclusion, RAD51B may act as an oncogene during GC progression, and its hyperexpression may be a potential biomarker for early detection and poor prognosis of GC.",Nov-16,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:11,,14969-14978,,11,37,,Tumor Biol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: London Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000388799900058,,,,Gastric cancer; ADENOCARCINOMA; Prognosis; PATTERNS; ROLES; REPAIR; Drug resistance; DRUG-RESISTANCE; Genomic instability; Oncogene; PHASE; RAD51B; RECOMBINATION; 868,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early defection remains the most promising approach to improving long-term survival of patients with GC. We previously performed Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) oil 4 primary GCs and identified several GC-specific genes including Reg IV. Of these genes, olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4, also knonwn as GW112 or hGC-1) is a candidate gene for cancer-specific expression. In this study, we examined the expression of olfactomedin 4 in human GC by immunohistochemistry. We also assessed serum olfactomedin 4 levels in GC patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 94 (56%) of 167 GC cases were positive for olfactomedin 4 by immunostaining. Olfactomedin 4 staining was observed more frequently in stage I/II cases than in stage III/IV cases. The serum olfactomedin 4 concentration in presurgical GC patients (n = 123, mean +/- SE, 36.3 +/- 3.5 ng/mL) was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals (n = 76, 16.6 +/- 1.6 ng/mL). In patients with stage 1 GC, the sensitivity of serum olfactomedin 4 (25%) and Reg IV (35%) was superior to that of CA19-9 (5%) or CEA (3%). Furthermore, in patients with stage I GC. the combination of olfactomedin 4 and Reg IV elevated the diagnostic Sensitivity to These results suggest that serum olfactomedin 4 is it useful marker for GC and its measurement alone or in combination with Reg IV has utility in the early defection of GC.

To identify candidate biomarkers of GC, 88 serum samples were first screened using a high-throughput protein microarray to measure the levels of 640 proteins. Then, 333 samples were used to validate the potential biomarkers using a custom antibody chip. ELISA, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were then used to verify the expression of the target proteins. Finally, logistic regression was performed to select serum proteins for the diagnostic model. As a result, five specific differentially expressed proteins, TGF beta RIII, LAG-3, carboxypeptidase A2, Decorin and ANGPTL3, were found to have the ability to distinguish GC. Logistic regression analysis showed that the combination of carboxypeptidase A2 and TGF beta RIII had superior potential for diagnosing GC (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.801).

Metabolites profiling on patient plasma was performed. Furthermore, the proposed biomarkers were used to create random forest models, in which discrimination efficiency and accuracy were ascertained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. l-carnitine, l-proline, pyruvaldehyde, phosphatidylcholines (PC) (14:0/18:0), lysophosphatidylcholine (14:0) (LysoPC 14:0), lysinoalanine were defined as the potential biomarker panel for the diagnosis among CSG and EGC patients.

Many studies have reported on the potential value of microRNAs (miRNAs) detection for diagnosing GC, but their results have proven inconclusive. The present meta-analysis was conducted to assess the diagnostic value of circulating miRNAs for GC diagnosis. A literature search was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, and CNKI) and other sources using combinations of keywords relating to GC, miRNAs, and diagnosis. The values of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios (PLR), negative likelihood ratios (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) reported in individual studies were pooled using random-effects models. Potential sources of heterogeneity were assessed with subgroup and meta-regression analyses. The summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the diagnosis accuracy of miRNAs. This meta-analysis included 1,279 patients with GC and 954 healthy controls from 20 publications. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, DOR, and AUC were 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.73-0.81), 0.80 (95 % CI: 0.76-0.84), 4.0 (95 % CI: 3.1-6.0), 0.28 (95 % CI: 0.23-0.34), 14 (95 % CI: 10-21), and 0.86 (95 % CI: 0.83-0.89), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that early stages (I and II) GC were more easily detected than later stages and that multiple miRNAs assays were more accurate than single miRNA assays. Our meta-analysis suggests that miRNAs have a high diagnostic value for GC, especially in its early stages (I and II). In addition, multiple miRNAs assays have a better diagnosis value than single miRNA assays.

Although its incidence rates in the West are lower than that in Asia, gastric cancer is still a major health problem worldwide, being second only to lung cancers in the number of deaths it causes. Helicobacter pylori infection has been identified as the major pathogen, but the detailed pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma remains elusive. Due to the lack of suitable and specific biomarkers for early detection, most cases of the disease are diagnosed at late stages and the survival rate is low. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to globally analyze the protein profiles of paired surgical specimens of primary gastric adenocarcinoma and nontumor mucosa aiming at identifying specific disease-associated proteins as potential clinical biomarkers and for carcinogenetic study. Compared to nontumor tissues, multiple protein alterations were found in tumor tissues. Some of these alterations involve variations in the expression of cytoskeleton proteins, including an increase in cytokeratin 8 and tropomyosin isoform and a decrease in cytokeratin 20. Co-up-regulations of heat-shock proteins and glycolytic enzymes were observed in tumor tissues, indicating self-protective efforts of cells and the growing energy requirement during malignant transformation. Diverse regulations also occurred with proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, such as GMP reductase 2 and creatine kinase B, and proteins bearing potential tumor suppressor activities, including prohibitin and selenium binding protein 1. More interestingly, a human stomach-specific protein, 18 kDa antrum mucosa protein, was found to be dramatically under-expressed in cancer tissues, implicating a possible special pathological role for this protein in gastric carcinogenesis.

The fluorescence intensity (FI), tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and total protein content were significantly higher in the gastric juice of patients with gastric malignancies (all P < 0.01). With all P < 0.001, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the biomarkers were tyrosine, 0.838; phenylalanine, 0.856; and tryptophan, 0.816. At a specificity of 79.4%, the sensitivity for gastric malignancy detection with phenylalanine was 87.9% only.

This is because the disease is not identified in the West until later in its evolution. T I cancer has an excellent prognosis, but most of the patients either have no symptoms or complain of long-standing, non-specific dyspepsia; alarm symptoms, when identified, usually indicate that the cancer is already inoperable. Early gastric cancer is infrequently diagnosed in the West because the low prevalence of gastric cancer means that endoscopists do not search with the same diligence as they do in Japan. A further barrier is the widespread prescription of proton pump inhibitors that heal malignant ulcers and diminish symptoms, thus rendering them more difficult to identify clinically and endoscopically. An improvement in diagnosis may be achieved by newer endoscopy technology which enables cancers to be identified more easily, or by an inexpensive screening test to select patients with extensive gastric atrophy, thereby identifying those at risk who can then be screened endoscopically.",2006,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:20,,697-708,,4,20,,Best Pract.

This study assessed whether specific training of endoscopists improves the detection rate of EGC. The rates of detection of EGC by endoscopists at the Digestive Endoscopy Center of the Affiliated Nanfang Hospital of China Southern Medical University between January 2013 and May 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Because some endoscopists received training in the diagnosis of EGC, beginning in September 2013, the study was divided into 3 time periods: January to September 2013 (period 1), September 2013 to January 2014 (period 2), and January to May 2014 (period 3). The rates of EGC detection during these 3 periods were analyzed. From January 2013 to May 2014, a total of 25,314 gastroscopy examinations were performed at our center, with 48 of these examinations (0.2%) detecting EGCs, accounting for 12.1% (48/396) of the total number of gastric cancers detected. The EGC detection rates by trained endoscopists during periods 1, 2, and 3 were 0.3%, 0.6%, and 1.5%, respectively, accounting for 22.0%, 39.0%, and 60.0%, respectively, of the gastric cancers detected during these time periods. In comparison, the EGC detection rates by untrained endoscopists during periods 1, 2, and 3 were 0.05%, 0.08%, and 0.10%, respectively, accounting for 3.1%, 6.0%, and 5.7%, respectively, of the gastric cancers detected during these times. After training, the detection rate by some trained endoscopists markedly increased from 0.2% during period 1 to 2.3% during period 3. Further, the use of magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) (odds ratio = 3.1, 95% confidence interval 2.4-4.1, P < 0.001) contributed to the diagnosis of EGC.

High-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and mucosal cancer have a very low risk for lymphatic metastasis and therefore are suitable for endoscopic therapy. In HGIN and early oesophageal and gastric cancer, high-frequency miniprobes can provide detailed imaging of the different layers. However, diagnostic accuracy differentiating between mucosal and submucosal disease is not sufficient, and therefore (diagnostic) endoscopic resection should be performed in all localisable lesions to detect submucosal cancer at risk for lymph node metastasis. EUS for lymph node staging is considered to be the method with the highest accuracy, especially compared with computed tomography. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the lack of effective decision support system for endoscopy, the detection of gastric cancer in the clinic is usually with low sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a Genetic Algorithm optimized Neural Network (GAoNN) approach for gastric cancer detection based on endoscopy reports mining. Considering the fact that gastric cancer sensitivity can significantly improve the 5-year survival rate of patients, both the prediction accuracy and the sensitivity are employed to construct a multiobjective optimization model for enhancing the classification performance of GAoNN. In particular, we extended an effective genetic algorithm Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to train a neural network and reduced the complexity in training hyperparameters and improved the efficiency by substituting the computationally intensive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm in a neural network. Specifically, we designed the novel crossover and mutation operators and modified the nondominated ranking and crowding distance sorting procedures in NSGA-II for GAoNN. Through testing on 8,546 real-world endoscopy reports, we show that GAoNN achieves a prediction accuracy up to 83.74%, which is better than several competitors by significantly increasing sensitivity to 83.14%. GAoNN also reduces the training time by 30.94% when compared with conventional SGD-based training, which indicates the feasibility of GAoNN in clinical practice.",Jun-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:04,,,,3,37,,Expert Syst.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 14 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000501710600001,,,,DIAGNOSIS; gastric cancer screening; NEURAL-NETWORK; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GENETIC ALGORITHM APPROACH; hyperparameters; multiobjective optimization; neural networks; NSGA-II; OPTIMIZATION; 632,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endoscopic resection, however, has been associated with higher recurrence and metachronous cancer rates than gastrectomy. This meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection and gastrectomy for EGC. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were electronically searched for relevant studies comparing endoscopic resection and gastrectomy for EGC from 1976 through March 2015. The primary endpoints were en bloc resection and histologically complete resection rates. The secondary endpoints were duration of hospital stay and rates of complications, recurrence, metachronous cancer and overall survival. This meta-analysis enrolled 10 studies with 2070 patients: 993 patients who underwent endoscopic resection and 1077 who underwent gastrectomy. Endoscopic resection was associated with shorter hospital stay (standardized mean difference -2.02; 95 % confidence interval [CI] -2.64 to -1.39) and lower complication rate (relative risk [RR] 0.41; 95 % CI 0.22-0.76) than gastrectomy. However, endoscopic resection was associated with lower rates of en bloc resection (odds ratio [OR] 0.05; 95 % CI 0.02-0.16) and histologically complete resection (OR 0.04; 95 % CI 0.01-0.11) and higher rates of recurrence (RR 5.23; 95 % CI 2.43-11.27) and metachronous cancer (RR 5.22; 95 % CI 2.40-11.34) than gastrectomy. Overall survival rate (OR 1.18; 95 % CI 0.76-1.82) was similar.

This study was to evaluate the expression of PVT1 in GC and further explore its clinical significance. Previous microarray datasets were analyzed to conduct a preliminary screening for candidate lncRNAs of gastric cancer biomarkers in human gastric cancer tissues. Expression levels of PVT1 in 111pairs of gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues, gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer juices compared to their corresponding controls were detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay.

We evaluated associations of temporal changes in multiple serological markers (pepsinogen I [PGI], PGII, PGI/II ratio, gastrin-17 and anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG) with risk for progression of gastric precancerous lesions. From 1997 to 2011, repeated esophagogastroduodenoscopies with gastric mucosal biopsies and blood sample collections were conducted on 2,039 participants (5,070 person-visits) in the Zhuanghe Gastric Diseases Screening Program, Liaoning, China. Serum biomarkers were measured using ELISA, and gastric biopsies were evaluated using standardized histologic criteria. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using generalized estimating equations for correlated binary outcomes. The ORs for progression of gastric conditions comparing those whose serum PGI, PGII, and anti-H. pylori IgG levels increased 50% relative to those whose decreased 50% were, respectively 1.67 (CI, 1.22-2.28), 1.80 (CI, 1.40-2.33) and 1.93 (CI, 1.48-2.52). The OR for those whose PGI/II ratio decreased 50% relative to those whose increased 50% was 1.40 (CI, 1.08-1.81), and for those whose PGII and anti-H. pylori IgG levels both increased 50% relative to those whose levels both decreased 50% the OR was 3.18 (CI, 2.05-4.93). Changes in gastrin-17 were not statistically significantly associated with progression. These findings suggest that temporal changes in serum PGI, PGII, PGI/II ratio, and anti-H. pylori IgG levels (especially PGII and anti-H. pylori IgG combined) may be useful for assessing and managing risk for progression of gastric precancerous lesions. What's new? Effectively managing precancerous gastric lesions could reduce the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer (GC). However, only a small percentage of these lesions actually develop into GC. Specific biomarkers would thus be extremely helpful for risk stratification. In this study, the authors evaluated multiple serological markers for any association between temporal changes in these markers and risk of progression to GC.

Our study aims to explore noninvasive multianalytical biomarkers and construct integrative models for preliminary risk assessment and GC detection. Whole genomewide methylation marker discovery was conducted with CpG tandems target amplification (CTTA) in cfDNA from large asymptomatic screening participants in a high-risk area of GC. The methylation and mutation candidates were validated simultaneously using one plasma from patients at various gastric lesion stages by multiplex profiling with Mutation Capsule Plus (MCP). Helicobacter pylori specific antibodies were detected with a recomLine assay. Integrated models were constructed and validated by the combination of multianalytical biomarkers. A total of 146 and 120 novel methylation markers were found in CpG islands and promoter regions across the genome with CTTA. The methylation markers together with the candidate mutations were validated with MCP and used to establish a 133-methylation-marker panel for risk assessment of suspicious precancerous lesions and GC cases and a 49-methylation-marker panel as well as a 144-amplicon-mutation panel for GC detection. An integrated model comprising both methylation and specific antibody panels performed better for risk assessment than a traditional model (AUC, 0.83 and 0.63, P < .001). A second model for GC detection integrating methylation and mutation panels also outperformed the traditional model (AUC, 0.82 and 0.68, P = .005).

The proportion of EGCs has been increasing due to the increase in screening endoscopy for gastric cancers; therefore, the paradigm shift from surgical resection to endoscopic resection as a treatment modality for selected EGCs is accelerating. For successful endoscopic resection of EGCs, it is important to detect EGCs at an early stage and to accurately predict the histological type, depth of invasion, and horizontal margins of the tumor. The diagnostic process of EGCs can be divided into three steps: presence diagnosis, qualitative diagnosis, and quantitative diagnosis. The presence diagnosis of EGCs is mainly based on two endoscopic findings: a well-demarcated lesion and irregularity in the color/surface pattern. Qualitative diagnosis refers to the prediction of histological type, which is mainly possible based on the macroscopic shape and color of the lesion. Quantitative diagnosis of EGCs consists of predicting the depth of invasion by detailed examination of the macroscopic morphology and determining horizontal margins using chromoendoscopy. Although advanced diagnostic modalities, such as endosonography or magnifying endoscopy, are helpful for the qualitative and quantitative diagnosis of EGCs, these modalities are not available in most hospitals. Therefore, it is still very important to evaluate EGCs systematically during conventional endoscopy for successful endoscopic treatment.

The rate of EGC, which varies by country, is up to 40-60% of all gastric cancer cases in Japan, whilst in Western countries, the proportion remains at 5-10%. There is a strong male predominance in EGC. The average 5-year survival rate of patients with EGC reached over 90% in Japanese and European data. Many EGC patients present with symptoms suggestive of a benign gastric ulcers. The combination of serum pepsinogen and Helicobacter pylori status may provide even more sensitive information for screening. However high-quality endoscopic evaluation with biopsy is the key to diagnosis. To improve the quality of observation several endoscopic imaging modalities have been developed for the diagnosis of early gastric cancer. Endoscopic resection is a viable alternative to surgery for curative treatment of EGC, with similar long term results. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of EGC without any risk of lymph node metastasis was developed in Japan in the 1980s, and it has been one of the standard treatments of EGC for nearly 20 years. Recently, several EMR techniques developed in Japan have been accepted and done in Western countries. These EMR techniques are safe and efficacious but unsuitable for large lesions. Because we could not remove a large lesion in 1 fragment, which was very important for the precise diagnosis of tumor depth, local recurrence increased in large-lesion cases. An innovative procedure using newly developed endoscopic knives, called endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), was developed in the late 1990s, which made it possible to remove a large lesion en bloc. Theoretically, ESD has no limitation with respect to tumor size; therefore, it is expected to replace the surgical treatment in some situations. Although ESD has spread throughout Japan within a short period, there remain several disadvantages, such as a higher incidence of complications and a requirement of higher endoscopic skills compared to those of conventional EMR methods.",2012,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:05,,,,3,83,,Ann.

Recent advances in multidetector computed tomography (CT) with multiplanar reformation (MPR) provide a powerful tool for identifying gastric wall invasion and the perigastric extent of gastric cancer. In addition, MPR images confer advantages in the assessment of both intra- and extraluminal processes of the gastric wall and the evaluation of more distant regions, such as the paraaortic lymph nodes and other abdominal organs. Virtual endoscopy performed after air distention of the stomach can aid in the evaluation of gastric endoluminal morphologic features and the extent of EGC. Moreover, virtual endoscopy helps in detecting subtle mucosal changes and differentiating them from submucosal lesions in the same way as conventional endoscopy. Virtual endoscopy can depict abnormal endoluminal lesions within a wider field of view than can conventional endoscopy, and there are no ""blind spots"" because retrospective image reformation is available, which provides useful information for preoperative mapping. Multidetector CT with MPR and virtual endoscopy is a powerful, noninvasive tool for the early detection and accurate preoperative staging of EGC.

The six kinds of biomarkers related to gastric cancer can be detected sensitively and synchronously in a short time. The specially designed three electrodes system enables cross-contamination to be avoided effectively. The linear ranges of detection of the electrochemical microfluidic chip were as follows: 0.37-90 ng mL(-1) for CEA, 10.75-172 U mL(-1) for CA19-9, 10-160 U L-1 for H.P., 35-560 ng mL(-1) for P53, 37.5-600 ng mL(-1) for PG I, and 2.5-80 ng mL(-1) for PG II. This method owns better sensitivity compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results of 394 specimens of gastric cancer sera. Furthermore, we established a multi-index prediction model based on the six kinds of biomarkers for predicting risk of gastric cancer.

The detection of cancer biomarkers plays a critical role not only in cancer early diagnosis, but also in classification and staging tumor progression, or assessment prognosis and treatment response. Currently, various molecular diagnostic techniques have been developed for cancer biomarker studies, with many of the more effective approaches requiring a separation step before detection. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can perform rapid and efficient separation with small samples, which is well-suited for analysis of both small- and macro- molecule biomarkers in complex samples. CE has different separation modes and can couple to different detectors into a variety of platforms, such as conducting studies on DNA/ RNA point mutation, protein misexpression, and metabolite abnormality. Similarly, microchip capillary electrophoresis (MCE) appears as a very important biomarker screening platform with the merits of high throughput, integration, and miniaturization, which makes it a promising clinical tool. By hyphenated different detectors, or integrated with immunoassay, PCR/LDR and related technologies, MCE can be constructed into diverse platforms used in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics study for biomarkers discovery. The multiplex biomarker screening approach via CE- or MCE-based platforms is becoming a trend. This paper focuses on studies of cancer biomarkers via CE/MCE platforms, based on the studies published over the past 3 years.

We performed dynamic gene screening based on high-throughput data analysis from patients with precancerous lesions and early gastric cancer (EGC) and identified a 10-gene panel by the lasso regression model. This panel demonstrated good diagnostic performance in TCGA (AUC = 0.95, sensitivity = 86.67 %, specificity = 90.63 %) and GEO (AUC = 0.84, sensitivity = 91.67 %, specificity = 78.13 %) cohorts. Moreover, three GC subtypes were clustered based on this panel, in which cluster 2 (C2) demonstrated the highest tumor progression level with a high expression of 10 genes, showing a decreased tumor mutation burden, significantly enriched epithelial-mesenchymal transition hallmark and increased immune exclusion/exhausted features. Finally, the cell localization of these panel genes was explored in scRNA-seq data based on more than 40,000 cells. The 10-gene panel is expected to be a new clinical early detection signature for GC and may aid in pro-gression assessment and personalized treatment of patients.(c) 2022 The Authors.

However, current clinical screening methods exhibit suboptimal efficacy. Methylation alterations identified from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) present a promising biomarker for early cancer detection. Our study focused on identifying gastric cancer-specific markers from cfDNA methylation to facilitate early detection. We enrolled 150 gastric cancer patients and 100 healthy controls in this study, and undertook genome-wide methylation profiling of cfDNA using cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing. We identified 21 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the gastric tumor and nontumor groups using multiple algorithms. Subsequently, using the 21 DMRs, we developed a gastric cancer detection model by random forest algorithm in the discovery set, and validated the model in an independent set.

MiRNAs have been shown to be potential cancer biomarkers that can be used to diagnose cancers. MiRNAs are single-stranded, small non-coding RNAs that are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of different oncogenes. Cancer tissues contain miRNAs that play a special role in the etiology of cancer development or limiting cancer suppression. Dysregulation of miRNAs occurs in a variety of malignancies, including gastrointestinal cancers. MiRNAs are stable and protected against degradation by RNase, which enables their detection in tissues and biological fluids. The results of many studies suggest that miRNAs have a relatively higher diagnostic efficiency in distinguishing cancer patients from healthy people. The researchers have identified many miRNA signature in the blood for the detection of gastrointestinal cancers.

An inducible system for expression of CagA was used to identify differentially upregulated membrane protein transcripts in vitro. The top hits were then analyzed in gene expression datasets comparing transcriptome of gastric cancer with normal tissue, to focus on markers retained in cancer. Among the transcripts enriched upon CagA induction in vitro, a significant elevation of CEACAM6 was noted in gene expression datasets of gastric cancer. We used quantitative digital immunohistochemistry to measure CEACAM6 protein levels in tissue microarrays of gastric cancer. We demonstrate an increase in CEACAM6 in early gastric cancers, when compared to matched normal tissue, with an AUC of 0.83 for diagnostic validity. Finally, we show that a fluorescently conjugated CEACAM6 antibody binds avidly to freshly resected gastric cancer xenograft samples and can be detected by endoscopy in real time. Together, these results suggest that CEACAM6 upregulation is a cell surface response to H. pylori CagA, and is retained in early gastric cancers.

Saliva samples were collected from patients with esophageal (n = 50) and gastric cancer (n = 63), and patients without cancer as controls (n = 20). Salivary metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify salivary biomarkers. We also examined the metabolic profiles of gastric cancer tissues and compared them with the salivary biomarkers. The sensitivity of the diagnostic models based on salivary biomarkers was assessed by comparing it with that of serum tumor markers. Additionally, using postoperative saliva samples collected from patients with gastric cancer, we analyzed the changes in the biomarkers' concentrations before and after surgery. Cytosine was detected as a salivary biomarker for gastric cancer, and cytosine, 2-oxoglutarate, and arginine were detected as salivary biomarkers for esophageal cancer. Cytidine, a cytosine nucleotide, showed decreased concentrations in gastric cancer tissues. The sensitivity of the diagnostic models for esophageal and gastric cancers was 66.0% and 47.6%, respectively, while that of serum tumor markers was 40%. Salivary cytosine concentration increased significantly postoperatively relative to the preoperative value. In summary, we identified salivary biomarkers for esophageal and gastric cancers, which showed diagnostic sensitivity at least comparable to that of serum tumor markers.

The proposed nano-flower structure with five petals was considered as the original shape and then was examined in terms of changes, including substrate changes, the type of structure, the presence or absence of holes on the structure, and different thicknesses of the desired biomarkers. It shows the optimal wavelength of LSPR at 652 nm, which is suitable for physiological environments such as blood and plasma. The creation of several holes caused a shift to the wavelength of 663.63 nm, which was about 12.12 nm, but due to the reduction of the peak intensity, the optimization steps were performed without holes.

A total of 7757 adults who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and serum CA72-4 level measurement in multicenters in Taiwan from January 2006 to August 2016 were recruited in this retrospective study. Risk factors for GC, serum tumor markers, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings were evaluated. High serum levels of CA72-4 were found in 7.2% of healthy adults. CA72-4 level showed lower sensitivity (33.3%) but higher specificity (92.8%); however, the positive predictive value was quite low (0.18%). After adjustment of clinical risk factors for GC using EGD findings, gastric ulcer (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.11), gastric polyps (aOR = 1.42), and atrophic gastritis (aOR = 1.27) were significantly associated with high serum CA72-4 levels.

The differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) were selected from datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The selected DMCs were validated and further selected in tissue samples (40 gastric cancer and 36 healthy white blood cell samples) and in a quarter sample volume of plasma samples (37 gastric cancer, 12 benign gastric disease, and 43 healthy individuals). The marker combination selected was then evaluated in a normal sample volume of plasma samples (35 gastric cancer, 39 control diseases, and 40 healthy individuals) using real-time methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The analysis of the results compared methods based on 2-Delta Delta Ct values and Ct values. In the results, 30 DMCs were selected through bioinformatics methods, and then 5 were selected for biological validation. The marker combination of two fragments of IRF4 (IRF4-1 and IRF4-2) and one of ZEB2 was selected due to its good performance. The Ct-based method was selected for its good results and practical advantages. The assay, IRF4-1 and IRF4-2 in one fluorescence channel and ZEB2 in another, obtained 74.3% sensitivity for the GC group at any stage, at 92.4% specificity.

However, to identify causal methylations out of a large number of potential polymorphic DNA methylation sites is challenging. This high-dimensional data brings two obstacles: first, many established statistical models are not scalable to so many features; second, multiple-test and overfitting become serious. To this end, a method to quickly filter candidate sites to narrow down targets for downstream analyses is urgently needed. BACkPAy is a pre-screening Bayesian approach to detect biological meaningful patterns of potential differential methylation levels with small sample size. BACkPAy prioritizes potentially important biomarkers by the Bayesian false discovery rate (FDR) approach. It filters non-informative sites (i.e., non-differential) with flat methylation pattern levels across experimental conditions. In this work, we applied BACkPAy to a genome-wide methylation dataset with three tissue types and each type contains three gastric cancer samples. We also applied LIMMA (Linear Models for Microarray and RNA-Seq Data) to compare its results with what we achieved by BACkPAy. Then, Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to visualize prognostics significant markers with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data for survival analysis. Using BACkPAy, we identified eight biological meaningful patterns/groups of differential probes from the DNA methylation dataset. Using TCGA data, we also identified five prognostic genes (i.e., predictive to the progression of gastric cancer) that contain some differential methylation probes, whereas no significant results was identified using the Benjamin-Hochberg FDR in LIMMA. We showed the importance of using BACkPAy for the analysis of DNA methylation data with extremely small sample size in gastric cancer. We revealed that RDH13, CLDN11, TMTC1, UCHL1, and FOXP2 can serve as predictive biomarkers for gastric cancer treatment and the promoter methylation level of these five genes in serum could have prognostic and diagnostic functions in gastric cancer patients.",2021/7/12,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,705708,,705708,12,,Front.

Controls (N = 163) were matched to cases on sex, year of birth, country of birth, and blood sample type using incidence density sampling. Genome-wide DNA methylation was measured using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip. Global measures of DNA methylation were defined as the median methylation M value, calculated for each of 13 CpG subsets representing genomic function, mean methylation and location, and reliability of measurement. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to assess associations between these global measures of methylation and gastric cancer risk, adjusting for Helicobacter pylori and other potential confounders. We tested nonlinear associations using quintiles of the global measure distribution. A genome-wide association study of DNA methylation and gastric cancer risk was also conducted (N = 484,989 CpGs) using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.

This study analyzed DIRAS3, and markers of autophagy (p62, and LC3B-II) in surgically resected GC samples from 420 patients. The promotion of autophagy by DIRAS3 in gastric cancer (GC) cells was explored, which might explain its inhibitory role in gastric cancer cells. DIRAS3 expression in GC was positively correlated with LC3B-II amount, and negatively with metastasis; DIRAS3 and p62 levels were independent prognostic factors in GC. Overexpression of DIRAS3 in BGC-823 cells induced autophagy, led to decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, increased apoptosis, and impaired migration and invasion. While knockdown of DIRAS3 promoted proliferation and migration in MKN-45 cells. Overexpression of DIRAS3 in BGC-823 cells elevated autophagy levels in subcutaneous xenograft and inhibited tumor growth in mice; the hematogenous liver and lung metastasis of cancer cells were also suppressed. In conclusion, the results suggest DIRAS3 may play a role in affecting proliferation and metastatic potential of GC cells, which may be associated with its involvement in autophagy regulation.",Oct-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:07,,1869-1886,,10,144,,J.

This entails failing in identification of reliable serum tumor markers for screening early GC (EGC) as well as persisting ominous prognosis of this disease. Recently, investigation of human noncoding genome, especially long noncoding molecules (lncRNAs), has provided promising data. As for GC, however, since the current information on GC-specific lncRNAs is still scarce and comes largely from analyses performed on tissue or serum of affected patients, we decided to review the current literature dealing with expression of such molecules in the gastric juice (GJ) of GC patients. In the case of GC, in fact, several cytological and molecular works have already demonstrated GJ to be an interesting biological material for improving clinicopathologic and prognostic knowledge of this cancer. For this review, we burrowed into the literature on lncRNAs expressed in GJ of GC patients. PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and ResearchGate were the search engines entertained. As of 2018, only seven studies have been reported. LINC00152, AA174084, UCA1, RMRP, ABHD11-AS1, LINC00982 and H19 were the GJ lncRNAs examined. Following our review, we can conclude that, due to their high specificity and reliability, GJ lncRNAs should deserve a prominent role in the field of GC research: importantly, they could be used for screening EGC, ameliorating the existing methods of staging (which are still far from being completely accurate), improving the prognostic capacity of the current diagnostic armamentarium and, finally, providing new and valuable therapeutic targets.",Sep-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:07,,1239-1246,,9,214,,Pathol.

Therefore, every endoscopist should be trained to master enough diagnostic skills to identify early gastric cancer that often shows minimal alteration from the surrounding mucosa, easily evading detection. For the first step, it is essential that endoscopists understand the normal gastric mucosa as well as the mucosal changes caused by chronic H. pylori infection, a high-risk condition for the development of gastric cancer. Once a suspicious lesion is identified, use of a dye-spraying method may be useful to clarify structural alteration caused by neoplastic changes and facilitate the biopsy sampling. Development of zoom ( magnifying) endoscopy enabling 80 x magnification with a one-touch switch from conventional endoscopic observation helps to identify the detailed surface structure as well as the vascular architecture of the mucosa without tissue biopsy. Combined with chromoendoscopy, this powerful endoscopic method can be used to identify small cancer foci or delineate the margin of early gastric cancer that can be treatable by mucosal dissection. Other new modalities using a variety of optical devices have been developed but the real value of their utility still remains to be proven in the actual clinical settings. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a curative and stomach-preserving treatment for early gastric cancer (EGC) associated with a low risk of lymph node metastasis. However, several studies have reported missed diagnosis of gastric cancer. Therefore, endoscopists are required to learn accurate diagnostic skills to eliminate endoscopic blind spots. A systematic screening protocol to map the entire stomach without blind spots reduces the risk of missed lesions. Knowledge of the features of EGC or dysplasia is essential to identify suspicious lesion. Information of the common sites of occurrence of EGC can also enable a detailed endoscopic examination to improve detection rates. Previous reports investigating the location of gastric cancers resected by ESD or surgery showed that the antrum and lesser curvature of stomach were predominantly affected. Helicobacter pylori-induced atrophic changes advance from the antrum to the corpus along the lesser curvature, predominantly affecting these areas. Gastric cancers in the antrum and the lower corpus are also commonly missed during screening examination. Therefore, a careful examination of the lower third stomach is warranted to avoid missing synchronous and metachronous gastric lesions.

Raman spectroscopy measurements as a fingerprint of biochemical structure, enable accurate prediction of gastric lesions non-destructively. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic power of Raman spectroscopy in early gastric cancer (EGC), and reveal dynamic biomolecular changes in vitro from normal to EGC. To clarify the biochemical alterations in Correa's cascade, Raman spectra of human normal gastric mucosa, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma were compared at tissue and cellular levels based on a self-developed data processing program. For effectively identify EGC, Raman spectroscopy was used combined with multiple machine learning methods, including partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) with leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation. A total of 450 Raman spectra were investigated in this study. The upregulation of nu sym(O-P-O) backbone (p < 0.001) was identified as a favorable factor for the diagnosis of EGC, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was up to 0.918. In addition, higher levels of lactic acid (p < 0.001), lipids (p < 0.001), phenylalanine (p = 0.002), and carotenoids (p < 0.001) were detected in EGC. Multivariate machine learning methods for diagnosis of EGC based on Raman spectroscopy, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 91.0%, 100%, 94.8%, and 95.8% for SVM, and 84.8%, 92.0%, 88.8%, and 95.5% for CNN, respectively.

Such biomarkers will enable the efficient prediction of therapeutic response and prognosis of GC patients and favor the establishment of an effective treatment strategy for each and every patient. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA sequences that play important roles in modulating key biological processes by regulating the expression of target genes. Expectedly, miRNAs are abnormally expressed within the tumor tissue and in associated biological fluids of GC patients including their blood, gastric juice, and urine.

The study enrolled 69 GC patients and 40 healthy individuals. CCR5, CCL5, PDGF-BB, and EphA7 levels, which have been identified in the carcinogenesis of many cancers, were measured in the blood samples using the ELISA method. CCR5, CCL5, PDGF-BB, and EphA7 were all correlated with GC diagnosis (CCR5, p < 0.001, r = -0.449; CCL5, p = 0.014, r = -0.234; PDGF-BB, p < 0.001, r = -0.700; EPHA7, p < 0.001, r = -0.617).

PDGF-BB had the highest positive and negative predictive values when evaluated in ROC analysis to determine its diagnostic significance (cut-off value: 59.8 ng/L; AUC: 0.92 (0.87-0.97)). As far as we know, this is the first study to investigate the potential connection between GC and these four biomarkers. The fact that serum CCR5, CCL5, EphA7, and especially PDGF-BB levels in the patient group were significantly higher compared to healthy controls indicates that they can be used with high accuracy in the early diagnosis of GC.

Current limitations of using non systematic examination during standard EGD could be at least partially responsible for the low incidence of early GC diagnosis in countries with a high prevalence of the disease. Originally proposed by Emura et al., systematic alphanumeric-coded endoscopy (SACE) is a novel method that facilitates complete examination of the upper GI tract based on sequential systematic overlapping photo-documentation using an endoluminal alphanumeric-coded nomenclature comprised of eight regions and 28 areas covering the entire surface upper GI surface. For precise localization or normal or abnormal areas, SACE incorporates a simple coordinate system based on the identification of certain natural axes, walls, curvatures and anatomical endoluminal landmarks. Efectiveness of SACE was recently demonstrated in a screening study that diagnosed early GC at a frequency of 0.30% (2/650) in healthy, average-risk volunteer subjects.

In contrast, early gastric cancer has a good to excellent prognosis, with 5-year survival rates as high as 92.6% after endoscopic resection. There remains an East-West divide for this disease, with high incidence countries such as Japan seeing earlier diagnoses and reduced mortality, in part thanks to the success of a national screening programme.

High-definition endoscopy with virtual chromoendoscopy is superior to white light endoscopy alone. These enhanced imaging modalities allow the experienced endoscopist to accurately and robustly detect high-risk lesions in the stomach. An endoscopy-led staging strategy would mean biopsies could be targeted to histologically confirm the endoscopic impression of premalignant lesions including atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and early cancer.

Since GC is often diagnosed in advanced stages, the best action may be to enable early diagnosis of the disease or even prevent it in the first place through identification and control of the underlying risk factors. Endoscopy, as the gold standard method, is both expensive and invasive, making it an unfavorable device in this regard. Therefore, it is crucial to implement a reliable region-specific screening and surveillance program to identify high-risk individuals with more efficient screening modalities. Here, in addition to a review of current GC knowledge, we presented the data of newly-established Population-based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) in Iran. Our assessment confirmed earlier reports of a very high GC incidence rate in the northwestern and northern provinces of Iran, most notably Ardabil. Along with the important role of conventional risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and high dietary intake of salt, of more interest, we highlighted new region-specific risk factors, namely hookah, and opium. In conclusion, it seems the best results in reducing GC incidence and mortality rates on larger scales arise from modifying behavioral and environmental risk factors and advancing genetic and molecular biomarkers in order to supersede endoscopy.

The best means of improving the survival of GC patients is to screen for and treat early lesions. However, GC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is associated with a poor prognosis. Current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies have not been successful in decreasing the global burden of the disease; therefore, the identification of reliable biomarkers for an early diagnosis, predictive markers of recurrence and survival and markers of drug sensitivity and/or resistance is urgently needed. The initiation and progression of GC depends not only on genetic alterations but also epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modification. Aberrant DNA methylation is the most well-defined epigenetic change in human cancers and is associated with inappropriate gene silencing. Therefore, an increasing number of genes methylated at the promoter region have been targeted as possible biomarkers for different purposes, including early detection, classification, the assessment of the tumor prognosis, the development of therapeutic strategies and patient follow-up. This review article summarizes the current understanding and recent evidence regarding DNA methylation markers in GC with a focus on the clinical potential of these markers.

The most impactful way to reduce GC mortality is via primary prevention, namely Helicobacter pylori eradication, and secondary prevention, namely endoscopic screening and surveillance of precancerous conditions, such as gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM). An emerging body of evidence supports the possible impact of these strategies on GC incidence and mortality in identifiable high-risk populations in the United States. Accordingly, the primary objective of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update (CPU) Expert Review is to provide best practice advice for primary and secondary prevention of GC in the context of current clinical practice and evidence in the United States. METHODS: This CPU Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute CPU Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology.

Herein, we report the novel fluorescent paper-based analytical devices (PADs) for detections of GC-related microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) and circular RNA from Hippocampus Abundant Transcript 1 gene (circRNA-HIAT1) with prominent reliability and sensitivity. The PADs, constructed by in-situ synthesis of blueemissive carbon dots (CDs) and conjugations of probe DNAs, exhibit the superior uniformity and stability. In the presence of targets, rolling circle amplifications (RCA) are triggered to generate long DNA strands for the assemblies of green-/red-emissive labels. Consequently, remarkable blue-to-green and blue-to-red emission color transitions of the PADs are achieved, implementing the color-analysis of miRNA-21 and circRNA-HIAT1, respectively. Benefited from the efficient RCA, coupled with the drastic ratiometric fluorescent changes, the limit of detections (LODs) of PADs are found to be several fM with the upper limit of the linear detection range at 1 nM. More importantly, the fluorescent PADs possess excellent specificity, as well as anti-interference capability in biological settings, enabling their applications in accurate GC screening with plasma samples. Overall, the proposed fluorescent PADs are featured with robust sensing platform, facile signal readout, and exceptional dualtype RNA sensing performance, holding high potential in point-of-care testing (POCT).",2022/2/1,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:57,,113781,,113781,197,,Biosens.

The elevated SRC activity in gastric cancer (GC) has prompted the need for the therapeutic application of dasatinib in GC. We observed that the efficacy of dasatinib varied with the GC cell lines. The differential effect of dasatinib was not correlated with the basal SRC activity of each cell line. Moreover, the GC cell lines showing the strong antitumor effects of dasatinib were refractory to other SRC inhibitors, i.e., bosutinib and saracatinib, suggesting that unexpected dasatinib's targets could exist. To profile the targets of dasatinib in GC, we performed activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) via mass spectrometry using a desthiobiotin-ATP probe. We identified 29 and 18 kinases as potential targets in dasatinib-sensitive (SNU-216, MKN-1) and -resistant (SNU-484, SNU-601) cell lines, respectively. The protein-protein interaction mapping of the differential drug targets in dasatinib-sensitive and -resistant GC using the STRING database suggested that dasatinib could target cellular energy homeostasis in the drug-sensitive GC.

We conducted a multicenter prospective uncontrolled trial of patients undergoing routine screening endoscopy patients. We determined the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of M-NBI according to the degree of certainty and need for biopsy, as assessed using the VS (vessel plus surface) classification system. We analyzed the endoscopic and histopathological characteristics of both false negative and false positive high confidence M-NBI diagnoses. We then developed a provisional diagnostic strategy based on the diagnostic performance and limitations identified in this study. A total of 1097 patients were enrolled in the study. We analyzed 371 detected lesions (20 cancers and 351 non-cancers). The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of high confidence M-NBI diagnoses were 98.1, 85.7 and 99.4 %, respectively. The false negative case was a pale mucosal lesion with tissue diagnosis of signet-ring cell carcinoma. Exclusion of pale mucosal lesions increased the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of high confidence M-NBI diagnoses to 99.4, 100 and 99.4 %, respectively.

It assisted endoscopy to improve the detection rate of early gastric cancer. The 5-year survival rate for advanced gastric cancer is less than 30%, while the 5-year survival rate for early gastric cancer is more than 90%. Therefore, earlier screening for gastric cancer can lead to a better prognosis. However, the detection rate of early gastric cancer in China has been extremely low due to many factors, such as the presence of gastric cancer without obvious symptoms, difficulty identifying lesions by the naked eye, and a lack of experience among endoscopists. The introduction of artificial intelligence can help mitigate these shortcomings and greatly improve the accuracy of screening. According to relevant reports, the sensitivity and accuracy of artificial intelligence trained on deep cirrocumulus neural networks are better than those of endoscopists, and evaluations also take less time, which can greatly reduce the burden on endoscopists.

Hence, in the present study, exosomes from the plasma of five healthy individuals and ten stage I GC patients and from culture media of four human primary stomach epithelial cells and four gastric cancer cells (GCCs) were isolated. Exosomal RNA profiling was performed using RNA sequencing to identify EGC-specific exosomal lncRNAs. A total of 79 and 285 exosomal RNAs were expressed at significantly higher levels in stage I GC patients and GCCs, respectively, than that in normal controls. Through combinational analysis of the RNA sequencing results, we found two EGC-specific exosomal lncRNAs, lncUEGC1 and lncUEGC2, which were further confirmed to be remarkably up-regulated in exosomes derived from EGC patients and GCCs. Furthermore, stability testing demonstrates that almost all the plasma lncUEGC1 was encapsulated within exosomes and thus protected from RNase degradation. The diagnostic accuracy of exosomal lncUEGC1 was evaluated, and lncUEGC1 exhibited AUC values of 0.8760 and 0.8406 in discriminating EGC patients from healthy individuals and those with premalignant chronic atrophic gastritis, respectively, which was higher than the diagnostic accuracy of carcinoembryonic antigen.

RNA methylation plays an important regulatory role in a variety of physiological activities, and it has drawn great attention in recent years. Methylated adenosine (A) modifications such as N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), N-1-methyladenosine (m(1)A), 2 '-O-methyladenosine (Am), N-6,2 '-O-dimethyladenosine (m(6)Am), and N-6,N-6-dimethyladenosine (m(2)(6)A) are typical epigenetic markers of RNA, and they are closely correlated to various diseases including cancer. Serum is a valuable source of biofluid for biomarker discovery, and determination of these adenosine modifications in human serum is desirable since they are emerging biomarkers for detection of diseases. In this work, a targeted quantitative analysis method using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) was developed and utilized to analyze these methylated adenosine modifications in serum samples. The concentration differences between the healthy volunteers and cancer patients were evaluated by Mann-Whitney test, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to access the potential of these nucleosides as biomarkers. We demonstrated the presence of the m(6)Am in human serum for the first time, and we successfully quantified the concentrations of A, m(6)A, m(1)A, and m(6)Am in serum samples from 99 healthy controls, 51 colorectal cancer patients, and 27 gastric cancer patients. We found that the levels of m(6)A and m(6)Am in serum were both increased in colorectal cancer or gastric cancer patients, compared to that in healthy controls. These results indicate that m(6)A and m(6)Am in serum may act as potential biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of colorectal cancer and gastric cancer. In addition, the present work will stimulate investigations on the effects of adenosine methylation on the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer and gastric cancer.",2021/7/26,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,694673,,694673,9,,Front.

Furthermore, ctDNA testing may be synergistically used with other multi-omic biomarkers to enhance early detection. For instance, assays may incorporate early detection proteins (i.e., CA-125), epigenetic markers, circulating tumor RNA, nucleosomes, exosomes, and associated immune markers.

The circRNA with the largest variation in expression (hsa_circ_0000751) was selected for further examination. The expression profile of hsa_circ_0000751 and its target-specific interactions with microRNAs (miRNAs) and downstream gene transcripts were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, luciferase reporter assays, and rescue assays in human tissues and cells.

Freeze-thaw experiment and incubation experiment confirmed the stability of gastric juice circRNAs. A total of 308 circRNAs, including 107 (34.74%) upregulated and 201 (65.26%) downregulated circRNAs, were found significantly aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer tissues. The top ten upregulated in gastric cancer tissues were hsa_circ_0035445, hsa_circ_0003789, hsa_circ_0063809, hsa_circ_0074362, hsa_circ_0006282, hsa_circ_0011107, hsa_circ_0084606, hsa_circ_0005556, hsa_circ_0050547, and hsa_circ_0006470, while the top ten downregulated ones were hsa_circ_0007099, hsa_circ_0001897, hsa_circ_0007707, hsa_circ_0008832, hsa_circ_0001546, hsa_circ_0002089, hsa_circ_0004680, hsa_circ_0000154, hsa_circ_0004458, and hsa_circ_0008394. The hot-point chromosomes were chr1, chr2, chr3, chr9, and chr17. Hsa_circ_0014717 was significantly downregulated in 77.2% (74/96) gastric cancer tissues. Its levels in gastric cancer tissues were related to tumor stage (P = 0.037), distal metastasis (P = 0.048), tissue carcinoembryonic antigen (P = 0.001), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 expression (P = 0.021). More importantly, hsa_circ_0014717 can stably exist in human gastric juice; and its nature meets the requirements of clinical detection. Our study uncovered the circRNA expression profile in human gastric cancer. Moreover, some circRNAs can stably exist in human body fluid, and has the potential to be used as novel biomarkers for the screening of high-risk gastric cancer patients.",Jun-17,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:10,,1173-1180,,6,6,,Cancer Med.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000403024100004,,,,Biomarker; BIOMARKER; gastric cancer; circular RNA; clinical significance; expression profile; 829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NLRP3, as an important inflammasome component, has crucial roles in initiating inflammation. However, the potential roles of NLRP3 in GC is unknown. Here, we show that NLRP3 expression is markedly upregulated in GC, which promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) secretion in macrophages. In addition, NLRP3 binds to cyclin-D1 (CCND1) promoter and promotes its transcription in gastric epithelial cells. Consequently, NLRP3 enhances epithelial cells proliferation and GC tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we identify miR-22, which is constitutively expressed in gastric mucosa, as a suppressor of NLRP3. MiR-22 directly targets NLRP3 and attenuates its oncogenic effects in vitro and in vivo. However, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection suppresses miR-22 expression, while enhances NLRP3 expression, and that triggers uncontrolled proliferation of epithelial cells and the emergence of GC. Thus, our research describes a mechanism by which miR-22 suppresses NLRP3 and maintains homeostasis of gastric microenvironments and suggests miR-22 as a potential target for the intervention of GC.",2018/2/15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,884-896,,7,37,,Oncogene,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 13 Place: London Publisher: Springernature Web of Science ID: WOS:000425281800006,,,,MICRORNAS; CELLS; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; IMMUNITY; SUPPRESSES; COLON; CANCER DEVELOPMENT; INFLAMMASOME; 780,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is relatively common among older adults in different parts of the world, but large variations exist. Helicobacter pylori-related CAG [multifocal] and autoimmune CAG (corpus-restricted) are apparently two different diseases, but they display overlapping features. Patients with cobalamin and/or iron deficiency anaemia or autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, should be offered screening for CAG. Pepsinogens, gastrin-17, and anti-H. pylori antibodies serum assays seem to be reliable non-invasive screening tools for the presence of CAG, helpful to identify individuals to refer to gastroscopy with five standard gastric biopsies in order to obtain histological confirmation of diagnosis. Patients with CAG are at increased risk of developing gastric cancer, and they should be estimated with histological staging systems (OLGA or OLGIM). H. pylori eradication may be beneficial by modifying the natural history of atrophy, but not that of intestinal metaplasia. Patients with advanced stages of CAG (Stage III/IV OLGA or OLGIM) should undergo endoscopic surveillance every three years, those with autoimmune CAG every three-five years. In patients with CAG, a screening for autoimmune thyroid disease and micronutrient deficiencies, including iron and vitamin B-12, should be performed. The optimal treatment for dyspeptic symptoms in patients with CAG remains to be defined. Proton pump inhibitors are not indicated in hypochlorhydric CAG patients.

Receiver operator characteristics analysis was done for determining diagnostic utility of cyclin D1 and cyclin E2. We demonstrate that cyclins D1 and E2 are frequently overexpressed in early stages of gastric carcinoma. Interestingly, expression of cyclins D1 and E2 significantly correlates with different clinical parameters such as gender, histological type (intestinal and diffuse), tumor location (proximal, middle, and distal), tumor differentiation (differentiated and undifferentiated), tumor invasion (serosal, lymphatic, and venous) and tumor metastasis (lymph node, peritoneal, ascites, and liver). Cyclin D1 has significantly higher sensitivity and specificity as diagnostic biomarker than cyclin E2.

Immunohistochemical analysis of 261 paraffin-embedded archived gastric cancer tissues showed that high CISD2 expression was significantly associated with clinical stage, TNM classifications, venous invasion and lymphatic invasion. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that high CISD2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poorer overall survival in the entire cohort.

Furthermore, we found that silencing endogenous CISD2 also significantly inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenicity of MGC-803 and SGC-7901 cells not only in vitro but also in vivo in NOD/SCID mice (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that CISD2 affected cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of gastric cancer cells through mediating the G1-to-S phase transition. Moreover, we demonstrated that the pro-proliferative effect of CISD2 on gastric cancer cells was associated with downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, and activation of AKT signaling.

This study investigated the diagnostic value of serum pepsinogen (PG), gastrin-17 (G-17), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antibodies, and proteomic profiling for CGC and precancerous lesions. We conducted a case-control study involving biopsy-confirmed patients with CGC (n = 60), low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (CLGD, n = 60), high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (CHGD, n = 64), and healthy controls (n = 120) matched for age and sex from high-incidence areas in China. Serological markers including PGI, PGII, G-17, and H. pylori were measured using ELISA and Western blot, while plasma protein markers were assessed using Olink (R) technology. The VSOLassoBag algorithm and nine machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to identify crucial features and construct predictive models. Various evaluation metrics, including the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), were utilized to compare predictive performance. Elevated PGII levels, decreased PGR, and H. pylori infection were significantly associated with an increased risk of CGC and precancerous lesions (P for trend < 0.05). The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model performed best in discriminative ability among the 9 ML models. Following feature reduction based on predictive performance, a final explainable XGBoost model was developed, incorporating five protein biomarkers (CDHR2, ICAM4, PTPRM, CDC27, and FLT1). This model exhibited excellent performance in distinguishing individuals with CGC and precancerous lesions from healthy controls (AUC = 0.931 for CGC, 0.867 for CHGD, and 0.763 for CLGD), surpassing the traditional serological marker-based model. This study underscores the diagnostic potential of serological markers and proteomic profiling in the detection of CGC.

Adenocarcinomas with elevated CEACAM6 expression were significantly associated with lymph node metastases and advanced stages. There were no relationships between CEACAM6 expression and tumor size, histological differentiation, or different subtypes, respectively. Moreover, higher expression of CEACAM6 was found to be correlated with short postoperative survival time of patients with gastric cancer.

To investigate CSCs in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated carcinoma (EBVaGC), we screened previously reported stem cell markers of gastric cancer in EBV-infected gastric cancer cell lines (TMK1 and NUGC3) and identified CD44v6v9 double positive cells as candidate CSCs. CD44v6/v9(+/+) cells were sorted from EBVaGC cell line (SNU719) cells and EBV-infected TMK1 cells and these cell populations showed high spheroid-forming ability and tumor formation in SCID mice compared with the respective CD44v6/v9(-/-) cells. Sphere-forming ability was dependent on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway, which was confirmed by decrease of sphere formation ability under BAY 11-7082. Small interfering RNA knockdown of latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A), one of the latent gene products of EBV infection, decreased spheroid formation in SNU719 cells. Transfection of the LMP2A gene increased the sphere-forming ability of TMK1 cells, which was mediated through NF-kappa B signaling. Together, these results indicate that CD44v6v9(+/+) cells are CSCs in EBVaGC that are maintained through the LMP2A/NF-kappa B pathway.

Epigenetics refers to the study of mechanisms that alter gene expression without permanently altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic alterations are reversible and heritable, and include changes in histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA-mediated gene silencing. Disruption of epigenetic processes can lead to altered gene function and malignant cellular transformation. Aberrant epigenetic modifications occur at the earliest stages of neoplastic transformation and are now believed to be essential players in cancer initiation and progression. Recent advances in epigenetics have not only offered a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism(s) of carcinogenesis, but have also allowed identification of clinically relevant putative biomarkers for the early detection, disease monitoring, prognosis and risk assessment of cancer patients. At this moment, DNA methylation and non-coding RNA including with microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent the largest body of available literature on epigenetic biomarkers with the highest potential for cancer diagnosis. Following identification of cell-free nucleic acids in systematic circulation, increasing evidence has demonstrated the potential of cell-free epigenetic biomarkers in the blood or other body fluids for cancer detection. In this article, we summarize the current state of knowledge on epigenetic biomarkers - primarily DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs - as potential substrates for cancer detection in gastric and colorectal cancer, the two most frequent cancers within the gastrointestinal tract. We also discuss the obstacles that have limited the routine use of epigenetic biomarkers in the clinical settings and provide our perspective on approaches that might help overcome these hurdles, so that these biomarkers can be readily developed for clinical management of cancer patients.

The present study analyzed the expression levels of phospholipids in plasma from patients with GC using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) to detect reliable biomarkers for GC. Furthermore, combining the results with a machine learning strategy, the present study attempted to establish a diagnostic system for GC. A total of 20 plasma samples from preoperative patients with GC and 16 plasma samples from tumor-free patients (controls) were selected from our biobank named 'SHINGEN (Yamanashi Biobank of Gastroenterological Cancers)', which includes a total of 1,592 plasma samples, and were analyzed by LC/ESI-MS. The obtained data were discriminated using a machine learning-based diagnostic algorithm, whose discriminant ability was confirmed through leave-one-out cross-validation. Using LC/ESI-MS, the levels of 236 lipid molecules were determined. Biomarker analysis revealed that a few lipids that were downregulated in the GC group could discriminate between the GC and control groups. Whole lipid composition analysis using partial least squares regression revealed good discrimination ability between the GC and control groups. Integrative analysis of all molecules using the aforementioned machine learning method exhibited a diagnostic accuracy of 94.4% (specificity, 93.8%; sensitivity, 95.0%). In conclusion, the outcomes of the present study suggested the potential future application of the aforementioned system in clinical settings. By accumulating more reliable data, the present system will be able to detect early-stage cancer and will be capable of predicting the efficacy of each therapeutic strategy.",May-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:59,,405,,5,21,,Oncol.

Although several new biomarkers and potential targets for therapy have been identified through biomolecular research in the last years, the effects on patients' outcome are still unsatisfactory. Increasing evidence indicates that hERG1 potassium channels are overexpressed in human primary cancers of different origin and several associations between hERG1 expression and clinicopathological features and/or outcome are emerging. Aberrant hERG1 expression may be exploited either for early diagnosis (especially in those cancers where it is expressed in the initial steps of tumor progression) or for therapy purposes. Indeed, hERG1 blockage impairs tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical mouse model. hERG1-based tumor therapy in humans, however, encounters the major hindrance of the potential cardiotoxicity that many hERG1 blockers exert.

CLDN18.2 is a promising molecule along with the presence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in gastric cancer. This study evaluated cell block (CB) preparations of serous cavity effusions for the feasibility for CLDN18.2 protein expression and compared the results with those of biopsy or resection specimens. The association of CLDN18.2 expression in effusion samples and the clinicopathological features were also investigated. MethodsCytological effusion specimens and matched surgical pathology biopsy or resection specimens of 43 gastric and gastroesophageal junctional cancer cases were stained for CLDN18.2 expression and quantified using immunohistochemistry based on the manufacturer's instructions. ResultsPositive staining was detected in 34 (79.1%) tissue and 27 (62.8%) effusion CB samples in this study. When ""positivity"" was defined as moderate-to-strong staining in >= 40% viable tumor cells, CLDN18.2 expression was observed in 24 (55.8%) tissue and 22 (51.2%) effusion CB samples. A cutoff of 40% for CLDN18.2 positivity was used to demonstrate high concordance (83.7%) between cytology CB and tissue specimens. The results showed that CLDN18.2 expression in effusion specimens correlated with tumor size (p = .021) but not with sex, age at diagnosis, primary tumor location, staging, Lauren phenotype, cytomorphologic features, or Epstein-Barr virus infection.

A reliable liquid biopsy for gastric cancer prediction is urgently needed and since tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are abundant in various body fluids, tRFs are possible new biomarkers for gastric cancer. MethodsA total of 438 plasma samples from patients with different gastric mucosal lesions as well as healthy individuals were collected. A specific reverse transcription primer, a forward primer, a reverse primer, and a TaqMan probe were designed. A standard curve was constructed and an absolute quantitation method was devised for detection of tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP in plasma samples of individuals with differing gastric mucosa lesions. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic values of tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP for individual with differing gastric mucosa. A Kaplan-Meier curve was established to calculate the prognostic value of tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP for advanced gastric cancer patients. Finally, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the independent prognostic value of tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP for advanced gastric cancer patients. ResultsA detection method for plasma tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP was successfully established. Levels of plasma tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP were shown to reflect a gradient change from healthy individuals to gastritis patients to early and advanced gastric cancer patients. Significant differences were found among individuals with differing gastric mucosa, with reduced levels of tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP significantly related to a poor prognosis. tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP was found to be an independent predictor of an unfavorable survival outcome. ConclusionsIn this study, we developed a quantitative detection method for plasma tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP that exhibited hypersensitivity, convenience, and specificity. Detection of tRF-33-P4R8YP9LON4VDP was found to be a valuable means by which to monitor different gastric mucosa and to predict patient prognosis.",2023/4/17,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,1106997,,1106997,13,,Front.

By integrating the color changes (PP sign) with the ""vessel plus surface (VS)"" classification system, we developed an innovative diagnostic system for EGC and named it ""Pink Microsurface Microvascular (PSV)"" system. Here, we aimed to elucidate the diagnostic performance of the PSV system for EGC.MethodsWe conducted a single-center prospective clinical study (before-after design) consisting of 2 cross-sectional studies at 2 separate periods. In the before phase, 184 suspected lesions were evaluated using the VS system under ME-NBI; in the after phase, 183 suspected lesions were evaluated using the PSV system. We compared the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) between the VS group and the PSV group.ResultsThe accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the VS system for EGC were 84.6%, 87.0%, 83.6%, 67.8%, and 94.2%, respectively, and those for the PSV system were 93.0%, 92.0%, 93.4%, 85.2%, and 96.6%, respectively. The accuracy, specificity, and PPV of the PSV system were superior to those of the VS system. However, the sensitivity and NPV did not significantly differ between the VS system and the PSV system. The VS system was inconclusive for 22 lesions (12.0%) and the PSV system was inconclusive for 11 lesions (6.0%). The PSV system could identify more suspicious lesions than the VS system.ConclusionsWe propose a new PSV diagnostic system by combining the VS system and the PP sign.

All patients were classified into three categories as follows according to the morphologic type of submucosal deformity identified by EUS: (1) no submucosal deformity, (2) wedge-shaped deformity, and (3) arch-shaped deformity. The presence of an arch-shaped submucosal deformity on EUS and an active endoscopic ulcer or surrounding mucosal fold convergence/clubbing on conventional endoscopy were defined as suggestive of deep submucosal cancer invasion (SCI).ResultsUpper location (p=0.034) and the presence of an arch-shaped submucosal deformity on EUS (p<0.001) were significant predictors of deep submucosal invasion, with the presence of an arch-shaped submucosal deformity showing the highest predictive value (odds ratio of 26.27). The overall diagnostic accuracy of EUS for predicting deep SCI was 83.5%, with a sensitivity of 84.0% and a specificity of 83.3%, which were significantly higher than those of conventional endoscopy. A larger lesion size and the presence of an arch-shaped submucosal deformity were significant factors associated with noncurative resection after ESD.ConclusionsSubmucosal deformity pattern analysis with EUS can provide more accurate information than conventional endoscopy for predicting deep SCI.

This study evaluated Talin-1 expression and its clinical significance in gastric cancer (GC), along with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) expression and its correlation with Talin-1.MethodsBioinformatics analysis assessed the potential prognostic value of Talin-1 and HER-2 in GC patients. The study included 223 GC patients (Signet Ring Cells and Intestinal subtypes) and 29 non-malignant tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarray slides evaluated Talin-1 and HER-2 expression and clinical significance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed their diagnostic value.ResultsBioinformatics identified Talin-1 as a potential prognostic factor and HER-2 as an oncogene in GC. Talin-1 and HER-2 expression increased in SRC-type GC samples compared to non-malignant tissues. High cytoplasmic Talin-1 expression inversely correlated with tumor expansion and invasion in SRC-type GC. Increased HER-2 expression positively correlated with metastasis. ROC curves showed significant diagnostic values for both proteins.ConclusionsHigher cytoplasmic Talin-1 expression is associated with less invasive tumor behavior, while increased membranous HER-2 expression is associated with metastasis in SRC-type GC.

Herein, we tried to explore the diagnostic value of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) in gastric cancers. Methods: In this study, we first analyzed the expression levels and prognostic value of IGFBP7 mRNA in gastric cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, we recruited 169 gastric cancer patients and 100 normal controls as training cohort, and 55 gastric cancer patients and 55 normal controls as independent validation cohort. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was applied to test the serum levels of IGFBP7. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC) were applied to evaluation the diagnostic value. Results: TCGA showed that IGFBP7 mRNA was dysregulated and associated with prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Then, we examined the expression of serum IGFBP7 and found that serum IGFBP7 expressed lower in gastric cancer patients than normal controls both in training and independent validation cohorts (p < 0.0001). In training cohort, with the cutoff value of 1.515 ng/ml, the AUC for distinguishing gastric cancer patients was 0.774 (95% CI [0.713-0.836]) with sensitivity of 36.7% (95% CI [29.5-44.5]) and specificity of 90.0% (95% CI [82.0-94.8]).

However, there are geographic differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori, and in the availability of medications and endoscopy. Thus, nationwide or regional consensus statements are needed to improve control of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. Materials and MethodsThis consensus statement for management of H. pylori in Taiwan has three major sections: (1) optimal diagnosis and indications; (2) current treatment strategies; and (3) screening-to-treat and surveillance for control of gastric cancer. The literature review emphasized recent data for development of draft statements and determination of levels of evidence. Twenty-five Taiwan experts conducted a consensus conference, by a modified Delphi process, to modify the draft statements. Consensus, defined as an agreement of least 80% of the experts, and recommendation grade were determined by anonymous voting. ResultsThere were 24 consensus statements. Section1 has seven statements on recommendations for the diagnosis and indications for treatment of H. pylori infection. Section 2 has 10 statements that provide an updated treatment algorithm for first-line, second-line, and third-line regimens. Section 3 has seven statements regarding H. pylori eradication for reducing the risk of gastric cancer, with a cost-benefit analysis.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) shows strong potential for detecting EGC and reducing cancer-care disparities caused by differences in endoscopists' skills. To be used in clinical practice, CAD should enable both the detection and the demarcation of lesions. This study proposes a scheme for the detection and delineation of EGC under white-light endoscopy and validates its performance using 1-year consecutive cases.MethodsOnly 300 endoscopic images randomly selected from 68 consecutive cases were used for training a convolutional neural network. All cases were treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection, enabling the accumulation of a training dataset in which the extent of lesions was precisely determined. For validation, 462 cancer images and 396 normal images from 137 consecutive cases were used. From the validation results, 38 randomly selected images were compared with those delineated by six endoscopists.ResultsSuccessful detections of EGC in 387 cancer images (83.8%) and the absence of lesions in 307 normal images (77.5%) were achieved. Positive and negative predictive values were 81.3% and 80.4%, respectively. Successful detection was achieved in 130 cases (94.9%). We achieved precise demarcation of EGC with a mean intersection over union of 66.5%, showing the extent of lesions with a smooth boundary; the results were comparable to those achieved by specialists.ConclusionsOur scheme, validated using 1-year consecutive cases, shows potential for demarcating EGC.

We aimed to elucidate the clinical features of gastric neoplasm in group A patients and reviewed advanced methods for mass screening. Materials and MethodsA total of 271 gastric epithelial neoplasm patients were enrolled. We classified them according to the H. pylori-PG system and determined the number of patients in each group. After excluding true H.pylori-negative cases from group A (group A'), we examined the differences between group A' and group non-A. ResultsGroup A included 30 (11%) patients, and only three of these were true negative for H.pylori. All patients in group A' (n=27) exhibited endoscopic atrophy in the gastric corpus. Serologically, these patients showed low gastrin, low PG II and high PG I/II ratio, indicative of post-eradication.

The early detection of cancer and down-staging screening for high risk patients are essential. Therefore, we aimed to validate serum markers for stratifying patients for further management.MethodsEndoscopy and histological examination were performed to determine high risk and gastric cancer patients. Rapid urease test, culture and histological tests were performed to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection. Serum pepsinogen (PG) I and II and anti-H. pylori IgG were measured by ELISA. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was used to extract the best cut-off point.ResultsTotally 752 non-cancer and 50 consecutive gastric cancer patients were involved. The corpus chronic gastritis (72%: 36/50 vs. 56.4%: 427/752), corpus atrophy (42.0%: 21/50 vs. 18.2%: 137/752) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) (64.0%: 32/50 vs. 21.5%: 162/752) were significantly higher in gastric cancer than non-cancer patients, respectively. Therefore, corpus chronic gastritis, corpus atrophy and IM were considered as high risk disease. The best serum marker to predict the high risk status was PGI/II <3.1 (sensitivity 67.2%, specificity 61%) and PGI/II further reduced to <2.2 (sensitivity 66%, specificity 65.1%) together with PGI <28ng/mL (sensitivity 70%, specificity 70%) were the best prediction for gastric cancer.

However, the value of lncRNAs in the diagnosis of gastric cancer remains unknown. To identify whether lncRNA-AA174084 is a potential marker for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC), the authors investigated its levels in tissues, blood, and gastric juices from patients with various stage of gastric tumorigenesis. METHODSTotal RNA in 860 specimens from patients and healthy controls was extracted. Levels of AA174084 in 134 paired GC tissues, 127 gastric mucosal tissues, 335 plasma samples, and 130 gastric juice samples at each stage of gastric tumorigenesis were measured using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The potential association between AA174084 levels and patients' clinicopathologic features were analyzed. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed for differentiating GC patients from controls. RESULTSExpression levels of AA174084 were down-regulated significantly in 95 of 134 GC tissues (71%) compared with the levels in paired, adjacent, normal tissues (P < .001). AA174084 levels had significant, negative correlations with age (P = .031), Borrmann type (P = .016), and perineural invasion (P = .032). Plasma AA174084 levels in patients with GC dropped markedly on day 15 after surgery compared with preoperative levels (P < .001) and were associated with invasion (P = .049) and lymphatic metastasis (P = .042). AA174084 levels in gastric juice from patients with GC were significantly higher than the levels in normal mucosa or in patients with minimal gastritis, gastric ulcers, and atrophic gastritis (P < .001).

This study aimed to screen new gastric cancer diagnostic biomarkers in the homologous recombination pathway and then used radiomic features to construct a prediction model of biomarker expression to guide the selection of chemotherapy regimens.MethodsGastric cancer transcriptome data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Machine learning methods were used to screen for diagnostic biomarkers of gastric cancer and validate them experimentally. Computed Tomography image data of gastric cancer patients and corresponding clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive and our imaging centre, and then the Computed Tomography images were subjected to feature extraction, and biomarker expression prediction models were constructed to analyze the correlation between the biomarker radiomics scores and clinicopathological features.ResultsWe screened RAD51D and XRCC2 in the homologous recombination pathway as biomarkers for gastric cancer diagnosis by machine learning, and the expression of RAD51D and XRCC2 was significantly positively correlated with pathological T stage, N stage, and TNM stage. Homologous recombination pathway blockade inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis, and reduces the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our predictive RAD51D and XRCC2 expression models were constructed using radiomics features, and all the models had high accuracy.

However, gastric cancer is occasionally discovered even after successful eradication therapy. Therefore, we examined the prognosis of gastric cancer patients, diagnosed after successful H.pylori eradication therapy. Materials and MethodsAll-cause death rates and gastric cancer-specific death rates in gastric cancer patients who received successful H.pylori eradication treatment was tracked and compared to rates in patients who did not receive successful eradication therapy. ResultsIn total, 160 gastric cancer patients were followed-up for up to 11.7years (mean 3.5years). Among them, 53 gastric cancer patients received successful H.pylori eradication therapy prior to gastric cancer diagnosis. During the follow-up period, 11 all-cause deaths occurred. In the successful eradication group, the proportion of patients with cancer stage I was higher. The proportions of patients who received curative endoscopic therapy and endoscopic examination in the 2years prior to gastric cancer diagnosis were also higher in the successful eradication group. Kaplan-Meier analysis of all-cause death and gastric cancer-specific death revealed a lower death rate in patients in the successful eradication group (P=.0139, and P=.0396, respectively, log-rank test).

We aim to construct a hierarchical artificial intelligence-based multimodal non-invasive method for pre-endoscopic risk screening, to provide tailored recommendations for endoscopy. MethodsFrom December 2022 to December 2023, a large-scale screening study was conducted in Fujian, China. Based on traditional Chinese medicine theory, we simultaneously collected tongue images and inquiry information from 1034 participants, considering the potential of these data for PLGC screening. Then, we introduced inquiry information for the first time, forming a multimodality artificial intelligence model to integrate tongue images and inquiry information for pre-endoscopic screening. Moreover, we validated this approach in another independent external validation cohort, comprising 143 participants from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. ResultsA multimodality artificial intelligence-assisted pre-endoscopic screening model based on tongue images and inquiry information (AITonguequiry) was constructed, adopting a hierarchical prediction strategy, achieving tailored endoscopic recommendations. Validation analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) values of AITonguequiry were 0.74 for overall PLGC (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.76, p < 0.05) and 0.82 for high-risk PLGC (95% CI 0.82-0.83, p < 0.05), which were significantly and robustly better than those of the independent use of either tongue images or inquiry information alone. In addition, AITonguequiry has superior performance compared to existing PLGC screening methodologies, with the AUC value enhancing 45% in terms of PLGC screening (0.74 vs. 0.51, p < 0.05) and 52% in terms of high-risk PLGC screening (0.82 vs. 0.54, p < 0.05). In the independent external verification, the AUC values were 0.69 for PLGC and 0.76 for high-risk PLGC.

Despite staging guidelines and standard treatment protocols, significant heterogeneity exists in patient survival and response to therapy for GC. Thus, an increasing number of research have examined prognostic models recently for screening high-risk GC patients. MethodsWe studied DEGs between GC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues in GEO and TCGA datasets. Then the candidate DEGs were further screened in TCGA cohort through univariate Cox regression analyses. Following this, LASSO regression was utilized to generate prognostic model of DEGs. We used the ROC curve, Kaplan-Meier curve, and risk score plot to evaluate the signature's performance and prognostic power. ESTIMATE, xCell, and TIDE algorithm were used to explore the relationship between the risk score and immune landscape relationship. As a final step, nomogram was developed in this study, utilizing both clinical characteristics and a prognostic model. ResultsThere were 3211 DEGs in TCGA, 2371 DEGs in GSE54129, 627 DEGs in GSE66229, and 329 DEGs in GSE64951 selected as candidate genes and intersected with to obtain DEGs. In total, the 208 DEGs were further screened in TCGA cohort through univariate Cox regression analyses. Following this, LASSO regression was utilized to generate prognostic model of 6 DEGs. External validation showed favorable predictive efficacy. We studied interaction between risk models, immunoscores, and immune cell infiltrate based on six-gene signature. The high-risk group exhibited significantly elevated ESTIMATE score, immunescore, and stromal score relative to low-risk group. The proportions of CD4(+) memory T cells, CD8(+) naive T cells, common lymphoid progenitor, plasmacytoid dentritic cell, gamma delta T cell, and B cell plasma were significantly enriched in low-risk group. According to TIDE, the TIDE scores, exclusion scores and dysfunction scores for low-risk group were lower than those for high-risk group. As a final step, nomogram was developed in this study, utilizing both clinical characteristics and a prognostic model. ConclusionIn conclusion, we discovered a 6 gene signature to forecast GC patients' OS. This risk signature proves to be a valuable clinical predictive tool for guiding clinical practice.",2023/6/19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:53,,1210994,,1210994,13,,Front.

The diagnosis often occurs at advanced stages when treatment options are limited and less effective. Early detection strategies are crucial to improving survival rates and outcomes for patients. Blue laser imaging (BLI) is an image-enhanced endoscopy technique that utilizes white light and narrow-band light to detect pathological changes in the mucosal architecture. This study aims at investigating the diagnostic performance of BLI for the detection of GC.MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases from inception until March 2023. Studies assessing the diagnostic efficacy of BLI for GC detection were included. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of BLI were calculated using pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with a random-effects model. Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the I2 statistic.ResultsSix studies were included in the pooled analysis. There were 708 patients with 380 GC lesions. Most of the lesions involved the lower two-thirds of the stomach. The pooled performance metrics of BLI for GC detection were as follows: sensitivity of 91.9% (95% CI 83.3-96.3%; I2 = 82.3%), specificity of 93.4% (95% CI 82.0-97.8%; I2 = 87.9%) and accuracy of 95.4% (95% CI 72.6-99.8%; I2 = 73.6%).ConclusionBLI demonstrates high diagnostic efficacy for the detection of GC.

The identification of hsa_circ_000200 was verified by RNase R and sequencing, and the expression of hsa_circ_000200 was evaluated using qRT-PCR. The biological function of hsa_circ_000200 in GC was verified in vitro.

Hsa_circ_000200 in serum exosomes showed better diagnostic ability than that of tissues and serum. Combined with clinicopathological parameters, its level was related to invasion depth, TNM staging, and distal metastasis. Functionally, knockdown of hsa_circ_000200 inhibited GC cells proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, while its overexpression played the opposite role. Importantly, exosomes with up-regulated hsa_circ_000200 promoted the proliferation and migration of co-cultured GC cells.

However, appropriate selection of candidates for endoscopic resection is crucial to sufficiently mitigate non-e-curative (NEC) resection. This study aims at identifying the various clinico-pathologic factors that independently predict the NEC outcome and depth of submucosal invasion following ESD procedure in patients with EGC.MethodsMultiple logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate factors that independently predict both non-curability phenomenon and the level of submucosal invasion in patients with early gastric neoplasia. Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences version 23 was used for analysis.ResultsA total of 153 patients (162 EGC lesions) underwent en-bloc ESD after which the rate of complete resection and non-e-curative outcome were 95% and 22.2%, correspondingly. Multivariate analysis depicted that tumor location in the upper two third of stomach (odds ratio [OR], 5.46; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.65-18.12; p = 0.006), tumor size >2cm (OR, 7.63; 95% CI, 2.29-25.42; p = 0.001), histologically undifferentiated tumor (OR, 15.54; 95% CI, 1.65-146.22; p = 0.001), and tumors with 0-IIa/0-IIc or their mixed variants with predominant 0-IIa/0-IIc (OR, 9.77; 95% CI, 1.23-77.65; p = 0.031) were all independent predictors of NEC resection for early gastric tumors. Additionally, location in the upper two third of the stomach (OR, 8.88; 95% CI, 2.90-27.17; p <0.001), ulcerated lesions (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.15-11.90; p = 0.028), lesions with >2cm (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.08-8.02; p = 0.036) and those with poor differentiation (OR, 6.51; 95% CI, 2.23-18.98; p = 0.001) were found to have significant association with submucosal invasion.ConclusionsTumors located in the upper two third of the stomach having a larger size (>2cm), poor histo-differentiation and a gross type of 0-IIa/0-IIc or their mixed variants with predominant 0-IIa/0-IIc were significantly associated with a risk of NEC after ESD procedure. Thus, early gastric tumors displaying these features need to be handled carefully during endoscopic resection.

As long noncoding RNA ZEB1-AS1 has been reported to function as an oncogene due to sponging microRNAs (miRNAs) in several cancers, we hypothesized that it could interact with specific miRNAs to form regulatory networks and facilitate the growth of gastric cancer (GC).MethodsMiRNAs interacting with ZEB1-AS1 were screened for and selected by bioinformatics analysis. Overexpression or repression of ZEB1-AS1 was performed to determine whether it could regulate selected miRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) validated the expression profiles of ZEB1-AS1 and miR-149-3p in GC cell lines and tissue. Statistical analysis determined the clinical significance of ZEB1-AS1 in relation to miR-149-3p. Cell counting, wound healing and transwell assays were performed to assess cell proliferation, migration and invasion. A luciferase reporter assay was utilized to confirm the putative miR-149-3p-binding sites in ZEB1-AS1.ResultsBriefly, bioinformatics analysis inferred that ZEB1-AS1 interacts with miR-204, miR-610, and miR-149. Gain- or loss-of function assays suggested that ZEB1-AS1 negatively regulates miR-149-3p, miR-204-5p and miR-610 in GC cells. Validated by qPCR, ZEB1-AS1 was up-regulated and miR-149-3p down-regulated in GC cells and tissue. Data analyses indicated that ZEB1-AS1 and miR-149-3p are associated with the independent diagnosis and prognosis of GC. Functional assays support the theory that miR-149-3p hinders GC proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas its overexpression abrogates the corresponding effects induced by ZEB1-AS1.

Here, we developed the ColoCaller test, which simultaneously detects the methylation status of the SDC2, TFPI2, WIF1, and NDRG4 genes in stool DNA, to optimize the screening of gastric and colorectal cancer in high-risk populations. MethodsA total of 217 stool samples from patients with gastrointestinal cancer and from patients with negative endoscopy were prospectively collected, complete with preoperative and postoperative clinical data from patients. The methylation of these samples was detected using ColoCaller, which was designed by selecting CpGs with a two-step screening strategy, and was interpreted using a prediction model built using libSVM to evaluate its clinical value for gastric and colorectal cancer screening. ResultsCompared to pathological diagnosis, the sensitivity and specificity of the ColoCaller test in 217 stool DNA samples were 95.56% and 91.86%, respectively, for colorectal cancer, and 67.5% and 97.81%, respectively, for gastric cancer. The detection limit was as low as 1% in 8 ng of DNA.

Moreover, details of MRGC and appropriate postoperative follow-up after PG with DFT are unclear.MethodsWe reviewed the medical records of 471 patients who underwent PG with DFT for cancer in a preceding, multicenter, retrospective study (rD-FLAP Study). We investigated the incidence of MRGC, frequency of follow-up endoscopy, and eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.ResultsMRGC was diagnosed in 42 (8.9%) of the 471 patients, and 56 lesions of MRGC were observed. The cumulative 5- and 10-year incidence rates were 5.7 and 11.4%, respectively. There was no clinicopathological difference at the time of primary PG between patients with and without MRGC. Curative resection for MRGC was performed for 49 (88%) lesions. All patients with a 1-year, follow-up, endoscopy interval were diagnosed with early-stage MRGC, and none of them died due to MRGC. Overall and disease-specific survival rates did not significantly differ between patients with and without MRGC. The incidence rate of MRGC in the eradicated group after PG was 10.8% and that in the uneradicated group was 19.6%, which was significantly higher than that in patients without H. pylori infection at primary PG (7.6%) (p = 0.049).ConclusionsThe incidence rate of MRGC after PG with DFT was 8.9%.

To strengthen diagnosing and screening is the key to improve the survival and life quality of patients with EGC. This study applied data mining methods to improve screening for the risk of EGC on the basis of noninvasive factors, and displayed important influence factors for the risk of EGC.MethodsThe dataset was derived from a project of the First Hospital Affiliated Guangdong Pharmaceutical University. A series of questionnaire surveys, serological examinations and endoscopy plus pathology biopsy were conducted in 618 patients with gastric diseases. Their risk of EGC was categorized into low and high risk of EGC by the results of endoscopy plus pathology biopsy. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used to solve imbalance categories of the risk of EGC. Four classification models of the risk of EGC was established, including logistic regression (LR) and three data mining algorithms.ResultsThe three data mining models had higher accuracy than the LR model. Gain curves of the three data mining models were convexes more closer to ideal curves by contrast with that of the LR model. AUC of the three data mining models were larger than that of the LR model as well. The three data mining models predicted the risk of EGC more effectively in comparison with the LR model. Moreover, this study found 16 important influence factors for the risk of EGC, such as occupations, helicobacter pylori infection, drinking hot water and so on.ConclusionsThe three data mining models have optimal predictive behaviors over the LR model, therefore can effectively evaluate the risk of EGC and assist clinicians in improving the diagnosis and screening of EGC. Sixteen important influence factors for the risk of EGC were illustrated, which may helpfully assess gastric carcinogenesis, and remind to early prevention and early detection of gastric cancer.

Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the pathogenesis and mechanism of disulfidptosis and GC for clinical diagnosis and intervention. Methods: RNA-sequencing data from several public data portals and clinical samples were collected. We compared the expression levels of four key genes of disulfidptosis, including SLC7A11, SLC3A2, RPN1, and NCKAP1, in GC and selected prognostic genes to build a novel GC prognosis-related nomogram model. The biological functions and immune landscape of the identified prognostic genes were explored. Results: Overexpressed NCKAP1 and SLC7A11 were prognostic disulfidptosis-related genes in GC. We combined these genes and several clinicopathological factors to build a prognostic nomogram model for GC. Meanwhile, the ROC curves showed that NCKAP1 and SLC7A11 were promising biomarkers for GC screening. The biological and cellular functions were focused on actin activities, GTPase and immunoreaction. The tumour immune microenvironment and immune therapy targets were identified. Competing endogenous RNA network was built to explore the downstream regulatory mechanisms. Finally, the elevated NCKAP1 and SLC7A11 expression in GC was validated via qRT-PCR in a cell line and tissue line. Conclusion: In conclusion, NCKAP1 and SLC7A11 are promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for GC that correlate with the activities of actin, energy metabolism of GTPase, immune infiltration and immunotherapy.",2024,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,1053-1066,,4,15,,J.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of TUS-OCCA for gastric cancer. Methods: Consecutive patients with gastric cancers who underwent resection in our hospital were enrolled. Before the lesion was resected, TUS-OCCA examination was performed by a skilled examiner who was blinded to the site, size, and endoscopy diagnosis of the lesion. TUS-OCCA findings were compared with those of endoscopy and pathological diagnoses as the gold standard. Results: There were a total of 288 consecutive patients enrolled in the study, including 228 with advanced gastric cancers (T2-T4 stage), 50 with early gastric cancer (26 with stage T1b and 24 with stage T1a), and 10 with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. TUS-OCCA had a detection rate of 100 % (228/228) for advanced gastric cancers, 77 % (20/26) for stage T1b, 67 % (16/24) for stage T1a, and 60 % (6/10) for high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. The majority of patients with undetectable neoplasms using TUS-OCCA were obese (body mass index, 28.7-31.8 kg/m(2)). The overall accuracy of TUS-OCCA in determining the T stage of gastric cancer was 77.3 % (62.5 % for T1a, 70 % for T1b, 71.1 % for T2, 85.2 % for T3, and 73.3 % for T4).

Therefore, a novel diagnostic method based on artificial intelligence (AI) was developed and its effectiveness was confirmed in many studies. AI system using convolutional neural network has showed marvelous results in the ongoing trials of computer-aided detection of colorectal polyps. Summary: With AI's efficient computational power and learning capacities, endoscopists could improve their diagnostic accuracy and avoid the overlooking or over-diagnosis of gastric neoplasm. Several systems have been reported to achieved decent accuracy. Thus, AI-assisted endoscopy showed great potential on more accurate and sensitive ways for early detection, differentiation, and invasion depth prediction of gastric lesions. However, the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety in daily practice remain to be tested. Key messages: This review summarizes the current status of different AI applications in early GC diagnosis.

However, gastric neoplasms can be missed during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy due to the subtle nature of these lesions and varying skill among endoscopists. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to detect focal lesions and diagnose gastric neoplasms on reducing the miss rate of gastric neoplasms in clinical practice. METHODS: This single-centre, randomised controlled, tandem trial was done at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China. We recruited consecutive patients (>/=18 years old) undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for screening, surveillance, or investigation of symptoms. Same-day tandem upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done where patients first underwent either AI-assisted (AI-first) or routine (routine-first) white light endoscopy, followed immediately by the other procedure, with targeted biopsies for all detected lesions taken at the end of the second examination. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the AI-first or routine-first group using a computer-generated random numerical series and block randomisation (block size of four). Endoscopists were not blinded to randomisation status, whereas patients and pathologists were. The primary endpoint was the miss rate of gastric neoplasms and the analysis was done per protocol. This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000034453, and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between July 6, 2020, and Dec 11, 2020, 907 patients were randomly assigned to the AI-first group and 905 to the routine-first group. The gastric neoplasm miss rate was significantly lower in the AI-first group than in the routine-first group (6.1%, 95% CI 1.6-17.9 [3/49] vs 27.3%, 15.5-43.0 [12/44]; relative risk 0.224, 95% CI 0.068-0.744; p=0.015). The only reported adverse event was bleeding from a target lesion after biopsy. INTERPRETATION: The use of an AI system during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy significantly reduced the gastric neoplasm miss rate. AI-assisted endoscopy has the potential to improve the yield of gastric neoplasms by endoscopists.

The objective of the study was to report the baseline screening findings in this trial. Methods: We recruited a total of 345 eligible clusters from seven screening centers. In the intervention group, participants from high-risk areas were screened by endoscopy; in non-high-risk areas, high-risk individuals were identified using a questionnaire and advised for endoscopy. Lugol's iodine staining in esophagus and indigo carmine dye in stomach were performed to aid in the diagnosis of suspicious lesions. The primary outcomes of this study were the detection rate (proportion of positive cases among individuals who underwent endoscopic screening) and early detection rate (the proportion of positive cases with stage 0/I among all positive cases). Results: A total of 149,956 eligible subjects were included. The detection rate was 0.7% in esophagus and 0.8% in stomach, respectively. Compared with non-high-risk areas, the detection rates in high-risk areas were higher, both in esophagus (0.9% vs. 0.1%) and in stomach (0.9% vs. 0.3%). The same difference was found for early-detection rate (esophagus: 92.9% vs. 53.3%; stomach: 81.5% vs. 33.3%). Conclusions: The diagnostic yield of both esophagus and stomach were higher in high-risk areas than in non-high-risk areas, even though in non-high-risk areas, only high-risk individuals were screened.

Methods: Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of KAP1, TIMP1, STC2, talin 2 (TLN2), sushi-repeat-containing protein, X-linked 2 (SRPX2) and secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich (SPARC) in the patients' peripheral blood karyocytes. The data were analyzed with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results: A total of 112 patients with gastric cancer, 42 patients with recurrence and 107 healthy volunteers were recruited. There were significant correlations between KAP1, TIMP1 and STC2 levels, and TNM tumor stages and distant metastases. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) of KAP1 was 0.803 +/- 0.040 (P = 0.0001), the AUC of TIMP1 was 0.767 +/- 0.043 (P = 0.0001) and the AUC of STC2 was 0.769 +/- 0.045 (P = 0.0001), thus differentiating preoperative gastric cancer patients from healthy volunteers by ROC curve analysis.

Methods: All 45,240 endoscopic images from 1364 patients were divided into a training dataset (35823 images from 1085 patients) and a validation dataset (9417 images from 279 patients). Another 1514 images from three other hospitals were used as external validation. We compared the diagnostic performance of the DCNN system with endoscopists, and then evaluated the performance of endoscopists with or without referring to the system. Thereafter, we evaluated the diagnostic ability of the DCNN system in video streams. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and Cohen's kappa coefficient were measured to assess the detection performance. Finding: The DCNN system showed good performance in EGC detection in validation datasets, with accuracy (85.1%-91.2%), sensitivity (85.9%-95.5%), specificity (81.7%-90.3%), and AUC (0.887-0.940). The DCNN system showed better diagnostic performance than endoscopists and improved the performance of endoscopists. The DCNN system was able to process oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) video streams to detect EGC lesions in real time.

METHODS: In this prospective study, 280 medical examiners underwent questionnaire, serum test and gastroscopy. They were divided into Gastric cancer (GC) and Non-Gastric cancer (NGC) group. NGC group was divided into Low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and Non-chronic atrophic gastritis (NCAG) group. RESULTS: Age, drinking, sex and Gastrin-17(G-17) was respectively independent risk factors for GC. Age, drinking and G-17 was independent risk factors for GC in men. G-17 of GC group was higher than that of LGIN and NCAG group (P<0.05). Pepsinogen I/II ratio (PGR) of GC was lower than that of NCAG group (P<0.05).

Herein, we have assessed its efficiency in GC screening, in parallel and in combination with serum pepsinogen (sPG) I/II ratio, as an established indicator of gastric atrophy. METHODS: The study population included GC (n = 53) and non-GC (n = 207) dyspeptic patients. The non-GC group was histologically categorized into CG (n = 104) and NM (n = 103) subgroups. The MtDNA-CN of PBLs was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The sPG I and II levels and anti-H. pylori serum IgG were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The mtDNA-CN was found significantly higher in GC vs. non-GC (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.4, 6.4) subjects. Conversely, GC patients had significantly lower sPG I/II ratio than the non-GC (OR = 3.2; CI = 1.4, 7.2) subjects. The combination of these two biomarkers yielded a dramatic amplification of the odds of GC risk in double-positive (high mtDNA-CN-low sPGI/II) subjects, in reference to double-negatives (low mtDNA-CN-high sPGI/II), when assessed against non-GC (OR = 27.1; CI = 5.0, 147.3), CG (OR = 13.1; CI = 2.4, 72.6), or NM (OR = 49.5; CI = 7.9, 311.6) groups.

However, this procedure may not be widely available for screening in the developing world, whereas in developed countries endoscopy is frequently used without major clinical gain. There is a high demand for a simple and non-invasive test for selecting the individuals at increased risk that should undergo the endoscopic examination. Here, we studied the feasibility of a nanomaterial-based breath test for identifying GC among patients with gastric complaints. Methods: Alveolar exhaled breath samples from 130 patients with gastric complaints (37 GC/32 ulcers / 61 less severe conditions) that underwent endoscopy/biopsy were analyzed using nanomaterial-based sensors. Predictive models were built employing discriminant factor analysis (DFA) pattern recognition, and their stability against possible confounding factors (alcohol/tobacco consumption; Helicobacter pylon) was tested. Classification success was determined (i) using leave-one-out cross-validation and (ii) by randomly blinding 25% of the samples as a validation set. Complementary chemical analysis of the breath samples was performed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Results: Three DFA models were developed that achieved excellent discrimination between the subpopulations: (i) GC vs benign gastric conditions, among all the patients (89% sensitivity; 90% specificity); (ii) early stage GC (I and II) vs late stage (III and IV), among GC patients (89% sensitivity; 94% specificity); and (iii) ulcer vs less severe, among benign conditions (84% sensitivity; 87% specificity). The models were insensitive against the tested confounding factors. Chemical analysis found that five volatile organic compounds (2-propenenitrile, 2-butoxy-ethanol, furfural, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and isoprene) were significantly elevated in patients with GC and/or peptic ulcer, as compared with less severe gastric conditions. The concentrations both in the room air and in the breath samples were in the single p.p.b.(v) range, except in the case of isoprene. Conclusion: The preliminary results of this pilot study could open a new and promising avenue to diagnose GC and distinguish it from other gastric diseases. It should be noted that the applied methods are complementary and the potential marker compounds identified by gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry are not necessarily responsible for the differences in the sensor responses. Although this pilot study does not allow drawing far-reaching conclusions, the encouraging preliminary results presented here have initiated a large multicentre clinical trial to confirm the observed patterns for GC and benign gastric conditions.",2013/3/5,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:17,,941-950,,4,108,,Br.

This review covers the technical characteristics, tolerability, safety and acceptability of TNE and also diagnostic accuracy, use as a screening tool and therapeutic applications. It includes practical advice from an ear, nose, throat (ENT) specialist to optimise TNE practice, identify ENT pathology and manage complications.; METHODS: A Medline search was performed using the terms ""transnasal"", ""ultrathin"", ""small calibre"", ""endoscopy"", ""EGD"" to identify relevant literature.; RESULTS: There is increasing evidence that TNE is better tolerated than standard endoscopy as measured using visual analogue scales, and the main area of discomfort is nasal during insertion of the TN endoscope, which seems remediable with adequate topical anaesthesia. The diagnostic yield has been found to be similar for detection of Barrett's oesophagus, gastric cancer and GORD-associated diseases. There are some potential issues regarding the accuracy of TNE in detecting small early gastric malignant lesions, especially those in the proximal stomach. TNE is feasible and safe in a primary care population and is ideal for screening for upper gastrointestinal pathology. It has an advantage as a diagnostic tool in the elderly and those with multiple comorbidities due to fewer adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. It has significant advantages for therapeutic procedures, especially negotiating upper oesophageal strictures and insertion of nasoenteric feeding tubes.; CONCLUSIONS: TNE is well tolerated and a valuable diagnostic tool. Further evidence is required to establish its accuracy for the diagnosis of early and small gastric malignancies. There is an emerging role for TNE in therapeutic endoscopy, which needs further study.",2016,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:00,,,,4,7,,Frontline Gastroenterol.,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 246-256 Place: England Web of Science ID: MEDLINE:28839865,,,,1265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methodology/Principal Findings: All subjects were selected from two large cohort studies. Differential miRNAs were identified in serum pools of GC and control using TaqMan low density array, and validated in individual from 82 pairs of GC and control, and 46 pairs of dysplasia and control by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The temporal trends of identified serum miRNA expression were further explored in a retrospective study on 58 GC patients who had at least one pre-GC diagnosis serum sample based on the long-term follow-up population. The miRNA profiling results demonstrated that 16 miRNAs were markedly upregulated in GC patients compared to controls. Further validation identified a panel of three serum miRNAs (miR-221, miR-744, and miR-376c) as potential biomarkers for GC detection, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-based risk assessment analysis revealed that this panel could distinguish GCs from controls with 82.4% sensitivity and 58.8% specificity. MiR-221 and miR-376c demonstrated significantly positive correlation with poor differentiation of GC, and miR-221 displayed higher level in dysplasia than in control. Furthermore, the retrospective study revealed an increasing trend of these three miRNA levels during GC development (P for trend, 0.05), and this panel could classify serum samples collected up to 5 years ahead of clinical GC diagnosis with 79.3% overall accuracy.

Methods: Transnasal EGD was carried out in 2791 examinations for the purposes of screening or other reasons. Controls were examined by transoral EGD and numbered 3591 examinations. The transnasal endoscope used was an EG530N. Lesions graded C-3 or higher by Kimura-Takemoto's classification were regarded as endoscopic atrophy. Results: (i) DR in all subjects and those with atrophy were not different between transnasal and transoral EGD. (ii) Multivariate analysis of DR in subjects with atrophy was carried out using five variables: gender, age, purposes of endoscopy, endoscopic insertion route and the four endoscopists. DR was significantly higher in males or subjects >= 60 years. No difference was noted between the endoscopic insertion routes (transnasal vs transoral). (iii) The subjects analyzed in (ii) were divided into the transnasal and transoral groups, and multivariate analysis of DR was carried out using four variables.

Methods: We performed immunoradiometric assays of serum pepsinogen I (PG I), II (PG II) levels, and QRT's in 10 endoscopically normal subjects, in 20 patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, and in 13 patients with biopsy-con firmed gastric adenocarcinoma. Results: Serum PG I, II levels, I/II ratio were significantly different among normal, gastritis, and cancer patients. Serum PG I/II ratios were much lower in cancer patients. Serum quinine levels by QRT were correlated with PG I/II ratio (r(s) = 0.39, p < 0.01). Age was negatively correlated both with PG I/II ratio (r(s) = -0.58, p < 0.01) and serum quinine level (r(s) = -0.45, p < 0.01). The screening using serum PG levels was more valid (sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 77%) than that using QRT alone. The combination of serum PG levels and QRT increased specificity for detecting gastric cancer to 87% without altering sensitivity. Conclusion: Although blood QRT is a useful addition to other serum screening tests for gastric cancer, these tests alone are not sufficiently accurate as screening tools for gastric cancer.

Methods: Seventy-four communities were randomly assigned to traditional endoscopy arm (TEA) or biomarker-based endoscopy arm (BEA). TEA uses a questionnaire for risk assessment, and BEA combines a questionnaire with biomarker detection. High-risk individuals in both arms underwent endoscopic screening. Participation and interim screening effectiveness in two arms were reported with baseline analysis. Results: In total, 5,798 participants in TEA and 5,158 in BEA were recruited, with a participation rate of 26.9%. BEA showed a significantly lower high-risk rate than TEA (15.2% vs. 38.9%) and a higher endoscopic participation rate for high-risk individuals (64.9% vs. 53.0%). The endoscopic screening results showed that there was no significant difference in detection rate of GC abnormalities between the two arms.

Material and Methods: Data on 35,525 patients who underwent endoscopy in the Endoscopic Center of Shanxi Cancer Hospital and associated medical group hospitals from January 2016 to December 2019 were collected. Two aspects of the high-risk and general population were analyzed retrospectively: 1. The detection rate of precancerous diseases. 2. The difference and distribution of the detection rate in different genders, different ages, and different pathologic types. Results: A total of 35,525 patients, 24,185 in the general population and 11,340 in the high-risk population, were examined by electronic gastroscopy and colonoscopy si-multaneously. Of these, 20,659 were men and 14,866 were women. The detection rate of gastric diseases (gastric cancer, gastric polyp, gastric ulcer, chronic atrophic gastritis) in the general population was 9.27%, and that in the high-risk population was 25.18%. The detection rate of colonic polyps was 53.76% in the general population and 56.77% in the high-risk population. Conclusion: Both the high-risk and the general population should consider gas-troscopy and colonoscopy as routine physical examination items.

The values of these 5 tumor markers in the diagnosis of gastric cancer were analyzed. RESULTS: The levels of serum CEA, CA72-4, CA19-9, and CA12-5 were higher in the GC group than in the GBD group and healthy subjects, and these differences were significant (P<0.001). Although the level of CA15-3 was higher than those of benign lesion and healthy control groups, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05).

All subjects were tested for G17, pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), PGI/PGII ratio (PGR), H. pylori, serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The difference of G17 secretion in different subjects and its correlation with PG were analyzed to investigate H. pylori infection and expound the effects of inflammatory indicators on G17.Results: There was no significant difference in G17 secretion level in people with different sex, age and BMI (p > .05). G17 positively correlated with PGI and PGII, but negatively correlated with PGR. The G17 level of H. pylori-positive subjects was 10.16 +/- 12.84, and prominently higher than that of H. pylori-negative subjects (3.27 +/- 6.65). SAA and H. pylori infection were the greater risk factors for G17 abnormality among various indicators. CRP and ESR had no effect on G17 abnormality.Conclusions: G17 secretion is closely related to PG and H. pylori.

Methods: Levels of HER2 and MYC genes were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and real-time PCR in 81 gastric cancer tissues, and by real-time PCR in 36 gastritis tissues. Real-time PCR for HER2 and MYC products was also performed on 184 plasma samples from 81 gastric cancers, eight gastric adenomas, 63 gastritis patients, and 32 healthy individuals. Results: HER2/HBB and MYC/HBB ratios in tissue and cell-free plasma from gastric cancer patients were significantly higher than those of gastritis tissue and cancer-free individuals. An optimized cut-off value of plasma target gene to HBB ratio, used to differentiate cancer patients from cancer-free individuals, was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Values of 2.0 were calculated for HER2 [area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.760] and 2.725 for MYC (AUC, 0.767).

METHODS: Of a cohort in 486,085 people of a routine health screening at the Health Centre, Fujun 180 Hospital, Quanzhou city, China, 56,286 people were investigated according to the presence of cancer during 2009-2014. The concentration of CEA and AFP were determined by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay from Roche Diagnostics e601GmbH and STK1 by a commercial kit based on an enhanced chemiluminescent dot blot assay. RESULTS: The cancer incident rate increased from 0.048/100,000 to 0.220/100,000. The most common types of tumors were those of the liver, cervix and lung. STK1 correlated to tumor growth rate, was more sensitive than CEA and AFP for discovering people with malignant tumors and more sensitive among people who had diagnosis of malignant tumor. STK1 was also a prognostic biomarker for death at 10-40 months follow-up, while CEA and AFP were not. A combination of these markers increased the sensitivity by about 30%. CONCLUSION: STK1 is a reliable biomarker for discovering people with malignant tumors in cancer screening.",2016,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:13,,529-536,,4,16,,Cancer Biomark.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: Amsterdam Publisher: Ios Press Web of Science ID: WOS:000374755400005,,,,RISK; PROGRESSION; CEA; AFP; health screening; MALIGNANT-TUMORS; THYMIDINE KINASE 1; Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1); 952,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the predictive power of serum trefoil factor (TFF) levels as biomarkers for gastric cancer in comparison with the pepsinogen (PG) test. Methods: Patients with gastric cancer, chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) or chronic non-atrophic gastritis (CNAG), and healthy people were recruited. Serum concentrations of TFFs, PG I, and PG II, as well as the presence of antibodies against Helicobacter pylori, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were used to compare the predictive powers of the selected factors. Results: The serum concentrations of TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 in the control groups were significantly lower than those in the gastric cancer group with the exception of TFF2 which was elevated in CAG. The area under the ROC curve for TFF3 was greater than that for the PG I/II ratio (0.81 vs 0.78). TFF3 also had a significantly higher predictive power for distinguishing gastric cancer than the PG test (odds ratio: 10.33 vs 2.57). Moreover, combining the serum TFF3 and PG tests for gastric cancer had better predictive power than either alone. Conclusions: Serum TFF3 may be a better predictor of gastric cancer than the PG test, while the combined testing of serum PG and TFF3 could further improve the efficacy of gastric cancer screening.",2014/4/11,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:16,,74,,1,14,,BMC Gastroenterol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: London Publisher: BMC Web of Science ID: WOS:000335460900001,,,,Gastric cancer; Pepsinogen; Diagnosis; POPULATION; CELL; TFF3; PROTEIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; SECRETION; CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS; FACTOR FAMILY-3; PEPSINOGEN TEST METHOD; PEPTIDE; Serum trefoil factors; 1074,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endoscopic evaluation of the degree and extent of atrophy of the gastric mucosa is a simple and very important means of identifying a group at high risk for gastric cancer. This study aimed to clarify the carcinogenic risk in relation to the degree of atrophy. Methods: A total of 27,777 patients (272 with early gastric cancer and 135 with advanced gastric cancer) were included in this study. Endoscopically evaluated atrophy of the gastric mucosa was classified as C-0 to O-3 according to the Kimura and Takemoto classification system. Results: The cancer detection rate in relation to the degree of gastric mucosal atrophy was 0.04% (2/4,183 patients) for C-0, 0% (0/4,506) for C-1, 0.25% (9/3,660) for C-2, 0.71% (21/2,960) for C-3, 1.32% (75/5,684) for O-1, 3.70% (140/3,780) for O-2 and 5.33% (160/3,004) for O-3. As to the proportions of differentiated and undifferentiated cancers, the latter were relatively frequent in the C-0 to C-2 groups, but differentiated cancers became predominant as atrophy progressed. On the other hand, the number of both differentiated and undifferentiated cancers detected increased as gastric mucosal atrophy progressed. In addition, open-type atrophy was found in 29 (96.7%) of 30 patients with synchronous multiple gastric cancers and in all 20 patients with metachronous multiple gastric cancers. Conclusion: Endoscopic evaluation of gastric mucosal atrophy can provide a simple and reliable predictive index for both current and future carcinogenic risk. (C) 2015 S.

In Turkey, the incidence of gastric cancer varies widely among regions due to the diverse cultures and accompanying food habits of the population. This study aimed to determine the endoscopic frequency of esophageal and gastric cancers and the usefulness of alarm symptoms in diagnosing gastric cancer in subjects undergoing endoscopy in northeastern Turkey. Methods: This retrospective study was based on hospital records, reviewing the records of patients who had underdone esophago-gastro-duodenal (EGD) video endoscopy at two general hospitals in Erzurum. From July 2010 to January 2013, 25,037 patients from Erzurum underwent EGD procedures under either intravenous sedation or local anesthesia. Classifications of UGI cancer, based on location of the tumor, were defined as esophageal, cardia, cardia and fundus or corpus or all of these, corpus, corpus and antrum, and antrum. Metastasis was studied in 659 patients diagnosed with cancer. Results: Throughout the study, 1,007 biopsy samples were reported as malignant tumors (719 gastric, 276 esophageal, and 12 duodenal cancers). The study considered the gastric cancer population under age 46, which included 99 (13.8 %) patients. Among them, the distribution of UGI cancer by age was as follows: under age 26 years, 9 patients (0.9 %); age 26-35 years, 30 patients (3 %); and age 36-45 years, 60 patients (6 %). Overall, 298 patients (298/1007, 29.6 %) presented with localized disease, and 361 patients (35.9 %) had distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Conclusions: We determined that UGI cancer patients are observed more frequently in northeastern Turkey than in western Turkey, Europe, and the USA. We believe that alarm symptoms and endoscopic scanning programs require new, region-specific criteria to diagnose UGI cancers in this region. For the patient groups with these different characteristics, we believe that new scanning, follow-up, and treatment strategies are needed that take into consideration differences in the histopathology of the tumors, their localization, and the patients' ages.",2016/10/4,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:11,,120,,1,16,,BMC Gastroenterol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: London Publisher: Biomed Central Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000384697100002,,,,Gastric Cancer; INVASION; CARCINOMA; MORTALITY; ESOPHAGEAL; PATTERNS; OUTCOMES; Esophageal Cancer; Gastric Cancer Epidemiology; Gastric Cancer Scanning; Northeastern Turkey; WORLD; 873,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past few decades, a number of different TAAs and their corresponding autoantibodies have been investigated. However, positive frequency of autoantibody detection in cancer patients has been relatively low. Here we describe a novel TAA that was a fragment derived from human DNA-topoiomerase I and an autoantibody against the novel TAA with relatively high positive frequency in the sera of early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: Serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot were used to discover a novel TAA with a molecular weight of 48 kDa separated by ion exchange chromatography. Autoantibody ELISA, immnohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining, recombinant protein cloning/expression and western blot were used to identify the novel TAA. The association of the autoantibody against the novel TAA with early-stage carcinoma was explored by screening 203 stage I/II patients and 170 stage III/IV patients with NSCLC, GC, CRC or ESCC. Results: We identified the novel TAA as a fragment derived from human DNA-topoiomerase I (TOP1). We found that the novel TAA induced specific autoantibodies with a high prevalence that ranged from 58 to 72% in some of the most common types of cancer. We observed that the immune response against the novel TAA was associated with early stage ESCC, GC, CRC and NSCLC. Conclusions: The findings in this study suggest that the autoantibody against the novel TAA may be a potential biomarker for use in the early detection and diagnosis of cancer.",2016/12/6,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:11,,1555-1564,,12,115,,Br.

Objective: To clarify the optimal interval between endoscopic examinations for the early diagnosis of both gastric cancers and adenomas. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: University-affiliated tertiary-care hospital, Seoul, Korea. Patients: Patients who were treated for gastric neoplasms between January 2008 and August 2013. Interventions: Questionnaire survey for interval between the penultimate endoscopy and diagnosis of a gastric neoplasm. A total of 846 patients were divided into 5 groups according to the interval between endoscopic examinations. Main Outcome Measurements: The proportion of gastric neoplasms treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection and the proportion of advanced gastric cancers according to the interval between endoscopic examinations. Results: In total, 197, 430, and 219 patients were diagnosed with gastric adenoma, early gastric cancer, and advanced gastric cancer, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the proportion of gastric neoplasms treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection was significantly higher in the <= 12 months, 12 to 24 months, and 24 to 36 months endoscopy interval groups than in the no endoscopy within 5 years group (all P < .001). In addition, the proportion of advanced gastric cancers was significantly lower in the <= 12 months and 12 to 24 months endoscopy interval groups than in the no endoscopy within 5 years group (all P < .001). Limitations: Retrospective study and recall bias. Conclusion: Annual endoscopy cannot facilitate the detection of endoscopically treatable gastric neoplasms compared with biennial or triennial endoscopy.

Aptamers are a group of promising probe that can specifically recognize and bind to target molecules and cells. Methods: Using an aptamer library, we selected high-specificity and high-affinity aptamers through 12 rounds of Cell-SELEX. The target protein could be extracted from early gastric cancer cells with streptavidin magnetic beads method and aptamers; before purification, the target protein was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The fluorescein-labeled aptamer was used for establishment and analysis of a new detection method for biomarkers. Then we used the ELISA (enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay) to verify the new detection method. Results: Ultimately, aptamer 7 (Ap7) was selected as the aptamer with the highest specificity and affinity in the screen, which targeted the early gastric cancer protein named early gastric cancer 7 (EGA7). Based on comparison of sequences in the NCBI database, EGA7 was identified as peroxiredoxin-4 (Prx4). Further analysis which contained the ELISA results showed a significant difference in EGA7 expression between early gastric cancer tissues and the normal gastric mucosa or advance gastric cancer tissues, confirming its utility as a marker for early gastric cancer. This is the first report using a high-specificity and high-affinity aptamer (Ap7) to screen for an early gastric cancer protein; using this method, a new biomarker, EGA7, was identified.

With the advent of the Human Genome Sequencing Project, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have attracted widespread attention in cancer research due to their stable ring structure. Our aim was to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in GC and explore their potential roles in GC diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic prediction. Methods: Large-scale gene screening was performed in three pairs of GC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues using high-throughput sequencing. The expression of hsa_circ_0001821 was detected in 80 pairs of tissue samples by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Stability of the ring structure of hsa_circ_0001821 RNA was verified by exonuclease digestion assay, and its diagnostic value was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. In addition, the location of hsa_circ_0001821 in GC cells was detected by nucleoplasm separation assay. Results: A total of 25,303 circRNAs were identified, among which 2,007 circRNAs were differentially expressed (fold change > 2.0, P < 0.05). Further validation disclosed that hsa_circ_0001821 was significantly downregulated in the 80 pairs of GC tissues and 30 whole-blood specimens obtained from the GC patients. The specificity of hsa_circ_0001821 in GC was higher than that in other solid tumors. In addition, hsa_ circ_0001821 was relatively stable after RNA exonuclease digestion. Clinicopathological parameter analysis showed that hsa_circ_0001821 was negatively correlated with tumor depth (r = -0.255, P = 0.022) and lymph node metastasis (r = -0.235, P = 0.036). Area under the curve (AUC) analysis showed that the diagnostic efficiency of circulating hsa_ circ_0001821 in distinguishing GC patients was higher than that in GC tissues (0.872, 95%CI: 0.767-0.977 vs. 0.792, 95%CI: 0.723-0.861). Combined use of circulating hsa_ circ_0001821 with the existing tumor markers yielded the largest AUC of 0.933. Finally, hsa_circ_0001821 was demonstrated to mainly locate in the cytoplasm, implying that it played a potential regulatory role in GC at the posttranscriptional level. Conclusion: Hsa_circ_0001821 may prove to be a new and promising potential biomarker for GC diagnosis.",2019/9/20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:04,,878,,878,10,,Front.

A Helicobacter pylori antibody test and eradication (H. pylori screening) reduces gastric cancer risk. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of H. pylori screening, compared to UGI and endoscopy in high prevalence countries. Methods: We developed decision trees with Markov models using a healthcare payer perspective and a lifetime horizon. Targeted populations were hypothetical cohorts of asymptomatic individuals at the age of 50, 60, 70 and 80 years. We calculated per-person costs and effectiveness with discounting at a fixed annual rate of 3% and compared incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results: H. pylori screening was cost-saving and more cost-effective for individuals at the age of 50, 60, 70, and 80 than UGI and endoscopy. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte-Carlo simulation for 10,000 trials demonstrated that H. pylori screening was cost-effective 100% of the time at a willingness-to-pay level of US$50,000/QALY gained. Conclusions: H. pylori screening for the adults 50 years of age and older could be cost-effective compared to UGI and endoscopy in high prevalence countries. The main reasons for the superiority of H. pylori screening are that an H. pylori antibody test has a higher sensitivity and specificity than UGI and endoscopy and the benefits to reduce gastric cancer incidence and mortality.",2019/6/3,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:05,,685-689,,6,54,,Scand.

Results: The expression of TM9SF4, CEA and CA 19-9 was evaluated in samples from 108 cancer patients (68 with GC and 40 CRC) and in healthy tissues from 20 non-cancer patients. Our results clearly suggest that TM9SF4 expression was significantly increased in GC and CRC samples and significantly correlated to disease stage in both cancer types. Conclusions: We propose TM9SF4 as highly specific cancer biomarker, exploitable for disease detection and staging of gastrointestinal cancers patients, with tumor tissue levels of expression outperforming those of clinically adopted markers such as CEA and CA 19-9.",Nov-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:01,,6652-6659,,11,9,,Transl.

The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum galectin-3(Gal-3) in patients with gastric cancer (GC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We measured serum Gal-3 levels using ELISA method in 87 patients with GC, 53 patients with benign gastric lesions, and 51 healthy controls. RESULTS: Serum levels of Gal-3 in patients with GC were significantly higher than those in benign disease patients and healthy controls (P<0.001), but no difference was found between benign disease patients and healthy controls (P=0.635). Additionally, serum Gal-3 level was associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.001) and distant metastasis (P<0.001), whereas it was not related to gender (P=0.204), age (P=0.269), tumor size (P=0.399), location (P=0.715), TNM stage (P=0.385), differentiation (P=0.135), or invasion depth (P=0.273).

The early diagnosis of GC could increase the five-year survival rate among patients. We aimed to find a panel of microRNAs (miRNA) for the detection of GC in the early stages. METHODS: In this case-control study, we selected consistently upregulated miRNAs from the results of 12 high-throughput miRNA profiling studies in GC. In the profiling phase, the differential expressions of 13 candidate miRNAs were analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in two pooled RNA samples prepared from the plasma of eight GC patients and eight matched controls. In the validation phase, significantly upregulated miRNAs from the profiling phase were further evaluated in the plasma samples of 97 patients with stage I-IV gastric adenocarcinoma and 100 healthy controls. RESULTS: In the profiling phase, six miRNAs (miR-18a, 21, 25, 92a, 125b and 221) were significantly upregulated in the GC patients compared to the controls (p<0.05). However, in the validation phase, only significant up-regulation of miR-18a, 21 and 125b was confirmed (p<0.05). A panel of miR-18a/21/125b was able to detect GC patients with stage I-IV from the controls (p<0.001; AUC=0.92, sensitivity=86%; specificity=85%). In addition, the panel could distinguish the early-stage GC (I+II) from the control group with an AUC of 0.83, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 75%.

Thus, the present study aimed to explore the diagnostic and prognostic significance of the four tumor markers for early gastric cancer. Methods: From September 2008 to March 2015, 587 early gastric cancer patients were given radical gastrectomy in our center. The clinicopathological characteristics were recorded. The association between levels of CEA and CA19-9 and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients were analyzed. Results: There were 444 men (75.6%) and 143 women (24.4%). The median age was 57 years (ranged 21-85). The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rate was 99.1%, 96.8% and 93.1%, respectively. The positive rate of CEA, CA19-9, AFP and CA125 was 4.3%, 4.8%, 1.5% and 1.9%, respectively. The positive rate of all markers combined was 10.4%. The associations between the clinicopathological features and levels of CEA and CA19-9 were analyzed. No significant association was found between CEA level and clinicopathological features. However, elevated CA19-9 level was correlated with female gender and presence of lymph node metastasis. Age > 60 years old, presence of lymph node metastasis and elevation of CEA level were independent risk factors for poor prognosis of early gastric cancer. Conclusions: The positive rates of CEA, CA19-9, APF and CA125 were relatively low for early gastric cancer. Elevation of CA19-9 level was associated with female gender and presence of lymph node metastasis.

Based on the gastroscopic pathology results, 12 specimens of patients with severe atrophy were screened to analyze the paraffin specimens of gastric mucosa by UCAD technology, and to explore the influence of related factors on them.Results: The results of CNV in TCGA database suggested that chromosome 7, 8, and 17 amplification was obvious in patients with gastric cancer. UCAD results confirmed that in 12 patients with pathologic diagnosis of severe atrophy, five of them had positive results of CIN, with a positive detection rate of 41.7%, which was mainly manifested in chromosome seven and chromosome eight segments amplification. We also found that intestinalization and HP infection were less associated with CIN.

Methods: Patients from consecutive regular health check-up were enrolled from January 2014 to June 2015. Endoscopy, combined with monitoring the Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infections, and measuring the serum pepsinogen (PG) were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of PG for the screening of atrophic gastritis. Histopathology was assessed by the Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) system. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software. Results: The total Hp infection rate was 40%. Based on pathology, the 996 participants were divided into three groups: non-atrophic (NAG), mild-moderate atrophic (MAG): stage I and II of the OLGA classification, and severe atrophic (SAG): stage III and IV of the OLGA classification. Compared with NAG and MAG groups, PGR decreased significantly in SAG group (p < 0.05). PGI and PGII levels were significantly elevated in Hp-positive group, while the PGR was markedly decreased (p < 0.01). When MAG and SAG groups were combined and compared with NAG group, the best cutoff value for atrophy diagnosis was PGI <= 50.3 ng/ml; the cutoff value in Hp-negative group was absolutely higher than in Hp-positive group. When NAG and MAG groups were combined and compared with the SAG group, the best cutoff value for diagnosis of severe atrophy was at PGR <= 4.28. The cutoff values in Hp-negative and Hp-positive groups were calculated at PGR <= 6.28 and <= 4.28, respectively. Conclusions: Pepsinogens play an important role in the identification of patients with atrophic gastritis and severe AG.

Patients and Methods: Serum samples were obtained preoperatively from 208 patients with histologically-confirmed GC, including 126 stage I patients (60.6%). Levels of S-p53Ab were assessed by a commercial laboratory using an anti-p53 detection kit. The cut-off value for S-p53Ab was 1.3 U/ml. Results: S-p53Ab was detected in 16.3% (34 of 208) of patients with GC, including 13.6% (22 of 162) of patients with early-stage GC. The positive rates for S-p53Ab, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of patients with stage I GC were 10.3% (13/126), 2.4% (3/126), and 8.7% (11/126), respectively. Positivity for S-p53Ab was not associated with CA19-9 or CEA positivity (p=0.098 and 0.053, respectively). The positive rate for a diagnosis of GC increased from 16.3% to 29.3% when S-p53-Ab was combined with CEA in this study. We found no significant correlation between the presence of S-p53Ab in GC and overall survival. Conversely, Cox regression analysis revealed that a high level of CA19-9 was an independent prognostic factor for GC in this series (hazard ratio(HR)=3.864; 95% confidence interval(CI)= 1.248-11.959; p=0.019). Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated significant differences in survival between patients with elevated levels of both S-p53Ab and CEA and those with elevated levels of only one or neither. Conclusion: The diagnostic rate of S-p53Ab was better than that of CA19-9 and CEA in patients with stage I GC.

Loss of this important structure can result in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), which carries a high mortality if early diagnosis is not made. Despite its clear genetic origin, optimal management of HDGC family members is controversial, as the utility and efficacy of current cancer screening programs for mutation carriers are unproven. METHODS: A 53-year-old Caucasian woman was initially seen for genetic screening because multiple family members had mutations of the CDH1 gene. Her pedigree analysis demonstrated 4 generations of gastric cancer, and 2 of the generations carried the CDH1 germline mutation, consistent with HDGC. At endoscopy, the patient's gastric mucosa was normal and random biopsies were also normal. The patient underwent a laparoscopic total gastrectomy. RESULTS: The gross examination of her stomach appeared normal. On histologic examination, however, the stomach was found to have diffuse (signet ring cell) adenocarcinoma in-situ with 11 microscopic foci of invasive adenocarcinoma limited to the lamina propria. CONCLUSION: Our case is the first reported prophylactic total gastrectomy utilizing a laparoscopic approach, and it highlights the importance of taking a thorough family history and obtaining a pedigree analysis. Endoscopic screening in HDGC cannot rule out diffuse GC, because the stomach and biopsies can be normal despite the presence of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, our case supports the recommendation for prophylactic gastrectomy in HDGC.",2007,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:20,,,,1,11,,Jsls,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 142-7 Place: United States Web of Science ID: 17651578,,,,1364; 1365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, endoscopy is an invasive procedure with low compliance and no plasma-based DNA methylation assay for the early detection of GICs.Methods: Nine potential DNA methylation markers were identified and evaluated in tissue (n=60) and plasma (n=155) cohorts to select the most suitable markers. A training cohort (n=244) and a validation cohort (n=199), including GICs patients, benign tumors, gastrointestinal polyps, and controls, were enrolled to develop and validate a DNA methylation panel. An independent prospective cohort (n=158) was used to validate the panel's performance and compare it with blood protein tumor markers.Results: Six out of nine candidate methylation markers with excellent discrimination abilities in both tissue and plasma cohorts were selected for the DNA methylation panel. The panel demonstrated high AUC values of 0.937 (EC), 0.968 (GC), and 0.987 (CRC) in training cohort, and achieved AUC values of 0.921 (EC), 0.921 (GC), and 0.959 (CRC) in validation cohort.

The current study aimed to investigate differentially expressed serum miRNAs in GC patients with DDP sensitivity and resistance and their ability to predict cisplatin treatment effectiveness. Methods: The DDP-resistant GC cell line MGC803/DDP was established for screening these dysregulated miRNAs through small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq), and the miRNA functions were annotated by bioinformatics analysis. RT-qPCR validated the relative miRNA transcription levels in GC cells and sera from 74 GC patients. The associations between the patient clinical parameters and miRNA expression were analyzed. The diagnostic value was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: sRNA-seq identified 35 miRNAs with differential expression between MGC803/DDP cells and MGC803 cells, with miR-3180-3p as the most significantly upregulated miRNA and miR-124-3p as the most significantly downregulated miRNA in MGC803/DDP cells. Clinical data analysis showed that compared with their expression in chemosensitive patients, miR-3180-3p expression was significantly upregulated and miR-124-3p expression was downregulated in chemoresistant GC patients (both p < 0.0001). A combination of the two miRNAs effectively distinguished the chemoresistant GC patients from the chemosensitive GC patients (AUC = 0.946 +/- 0.023, 95% CI = 0.900 - 0.991, p < 0.001, SE = 85.0%, SP = 82.4%). Downregulated miR-124-3p and upregulated miR-3180-3p were significantly correlated with a high TNM stage. Conclusions: The differentially expressed circulatory markers miR-124-3p, miR-3180-3p, and their combination can serve as serum-based biomarkers to predict the therapeutic benefit of DDP in GC.",2020,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:04,,2573-2584,,12,66,,Clin.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical significance of Slug expression in gastric cancer. Methods: The expression of Slug in gastric cancer tissues of 456 patients who underwent gastrectomy was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. Slug expression level was defined by the composite score determined by multiplying the tumor staining scores for intensity and extent. The associations of Slug expression with clinicopathological characteristics and overall and recurrence-free survival were analyzed. Results: Patients were divided into three groups according to Slug composite score (<= 4, 6, and 9). Low, mid, and high expression of Slug was observed in 104 (22.7%), 130 (28.3%), and 225 (49.0%) of cases, respectively. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival progressively increased from high to low Slug expression. In terms of lymph node metastasis, the rate of positive lymph node metastasis was 38/104 (36.5%), 79/130 (60.8%), and 178/225 (79.1%) in low, mid, and high Slug expression groups, respectively, displaying a tendency to increase with higher Slug expression. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for patient age, tumor size, tumor depth, and histology, high Slug expression was associated with a high rate of positive lymph node metastasis compared with low Slug expression (odds ratio 3.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.74-6.69). In a subgroup analysis of T1 cancer, patients with negative Slug expression (defined as <5% positive tumor cells or no/weak staining) showed no lymph node metastasis (0/13), whereas those with positive Slug expression showed 15.9% (17/107) lymph node metastasis, with a negative predictive value of 100%. Conclusions: High expression of Slug in gastric cancer tissue was associated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival. Evaluation of Slug would be useful for discriminating patients at high risk of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer.",2017/10/3,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:09,,670,,1,17,,BMC Cancer,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 9 Place: London Publisher: BMC Web of Science ID: WOS:000412096500001,,,,Gastric cancer; Prognosis; CARCINOMA; DIFFUSE; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; MESENCHYMAL TRANSITIONS; REPRESSES E-CADHERIN; Slug; SNAIL; Tissue microarray; 813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact of HP eradication on diagnosing GC during screening endoscopy. Methods: Eleven health checkup institutions in Japan participated in the present study. All GC cases newly diagnosed by screening endoscopy between January 2016 and December 2020 were included. After propensity score matching, multivariable regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of HP eradication on deep tumor invasion among HP-eradicated and HP-positive GC cases. Results: A total of 231 patients with GCs (134 HP-eradicated and 97 HP-positive cases) were enrolled. After propensity score matching, there were 81 cases in each group. The distribution of the depth of tumor invasion (pT1a, pT1b1, pT1b2, and pT2) between the HP-eradicated group and HP-positive group was similar (p = 0.82). In the propensity analysis, with HP-positive as the reference value, HP eradication was not significantly associated with T1b-T4-GCs and T1b2-T4-GCs, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.16 (0.48-2.81) and 1.16 (0.42-3.19), respectively.

However, optimal serum markers for advanced gastric precursor lesions are lacking. Aim: To evaluate in a case-control study whether serum leptin levels correlate with intestinal metaplasia (IM) and can serve as a tool to identify patients at high risk for GC. Materials and Methods: Cases were patients with a previous diagnosis of IM or dysplasia, controls were patients Without such a diagnosis. All patients underwent endoscopy. Fasting serum was collected for the measurement of leptin, pepsinogens I/II, gastrin, and Helicobacter pylori. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curves and their area under the curve (AUC) were provided to compare serum leptin levels with other serological markers. Results: One hundred nineteen cases and 98 controls were included. In cases, the median leptin levels were 116.6 pg/mL versus 81.9 pg/mL, in controls (p = .01). After adjustment for age, sex and BMI, leptin levels remained higher in cases than in controls (p < .005). In multivariate analysis, male sex (p = .002), age (<0.001), low pepsinogen levels (p = .004) and high leptin levels (p = .04) were independent markers for the presence of IM. in addition, a ROC curve including age, sex and pepsinogen I levels had an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI (0.73-0.85)). Adding serum leptin levels increased the AUC to 0.81 (95% CI (0.75-0.86)). Conclusions: High leptin levels are associated with an increased risk of IM. Moreover, serum leptin levels are a significant independent marker for the presence of IM. However, in combination with the serological test for pepsinogen I the additional value of serum leptin levels is rather limited.",Dec-09,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:19,,596-604,,6,14,,Helicobacter,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 9 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000272141700012,,,,DIAGNOSIS; FOLLOW-UP; gastric cancer; EXPRESSION; ASSOCIATION; INTESTINAL METAPLASIA; screening; RECEPTOR; ATROPHIC GASTRITIS; intestinal metaplasia; STOMACH; INFLAMMATION; PEPSINOGEN-I; Leptin; 1174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have evaluated the modifying effects of demographic factors on the risk impact of Hp sero-status/sPG levels in gastric cancer, with particular emphasis on age. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 1341 individuals (GC = 578, healthy = 763), who were stratified into two age groups: 35-59 years (middle-aged, n = 830) and >/= 60 years (60 years-plus, n = 511). Demographic factors and serological states (Hp sero-staus and sPG levels) were recorded by subject interview and serum ELISAs, respectively. Covariate-specific odds ratios were calculated by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Hp infection was consistently associated with increased sPGI and sPGII levels in the 60 year-plus, but not the middle-aged group. The joint examination of the variable states of the three serum biomarkers (Hp serology, sPGI, and sPGI/II ratio), in the 60 year-plus age group, demonstrated a stepwise escalation of risk from the single (sPGI low; OR = 2.6), to double (sPGI low/sPGI/II low; OR = 3.55, and Hp positive/sPGI low; OR = 5.0) and ultimately triple (Hp positive/PGI low/PGI/II low; OR = 10.48) positive states, in reference to the triple negatives. However, this pattern was not exhibited in the middle-aged subjects. CONCLUSION: Age was clearly identified as a modifying factor on the risk projection of the combined states of Hp serology and sPG levels in gastric cancer screening, reflected by the augmented (~10.5 fold) risk of GC in the triple positive (Hp positive/sPGI low/sPGI/II low) 60 year-plus subjects, which was not evident in the middle-aged group.",2015,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:59,,,,3,19,,Iran Biomed J,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 133-42 Place: Iran Web of Science ID: 26117138,,,,Biomarkers; 1348; Age distribution; Demography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to find serologic biomarkers for gastric cancer screening, we used proteomics to search for protein biomarkers that may be detected in serum of gastric cancer patients. Methods: Four groups of serum samples (from 20 gastric cancer patients) included pTNM stages I to IV were compared with two control groups of serum samples. The serum samples were first chromatographed using an immunoaffinity column to selectively remove albumin and IgG. Then serum proteins separated by 2-DE and identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Results: There were 3 proteins including complement C4-B precursor, complement factor I (CFI) precursor and haptoglobin precursor were found significantly different between the healthy and gastric cancer patients. Further validation study by Western blot showed that the detection of CFI precursor was under-expressed in gastric cancer sera compared to normal sera (p < 0.05), in addition to a declining expression with the advanced pTNM stage from stage I to IV of gastric cancer patients. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.78 for the expression of CFI precursor (p < 0.01). Conclusions: 2-DE-based serum proteome analysis may be useful in the screening of serum biomarkers for gastric cancer.

Gastroscopy and histopathological biopsy are still the gold standards for the diagnosis of gastric diseases. But the application of gastroscopy for the screening and diagnosis of gastric diseases is limited. In recent years, serum pepsinogen (PG), gastrin, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) IgG antibodies have become indicators for ""serological biopsy"" of the gastric mucosa. Methods: From January 2016 to January 2018, a total of 2,394 patients with digestive tract symptoms underwent gastroscopy. According to the endoscopic examination and pathological diagnosis, there were four case groups: 1,376 cases of chronic non-atrophic gastritis, 708 cases of chronic atrophic gastritis, 265 cases of gastric ulcer, and 45 cases of gastric cancer. Serological gastric biopsies were performed and analyzed. Results: The serum levels of PGI in the chronic atrophic gastritis group was significantly lower than that in the chronic non-atrophic gastritis group, gastric ulcer group, and gastric cancer group (p < 0.05). The serum levels of PGII and G-17 in the gastric cancer group were significantly higher than those in the chronic non-atrophic gastritis group, chronic atrophic gastritis group, and gastric ulcer group (p < 0.05).

As genes do not usually act alone in the pathway deregulation, gene pair combinations are more likely to become stable and accurate biomarkers. The purpose of our research is to establish a novel signature based on RBP gene pairs to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Methods: We downloaded genetic and clinical information from the TCGA and GEO database. TCGA and GSE13911 were used for screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The RBP genes were gathered from previous studies and employed to screen out DE-RBP genes after intersecting with DEGs. Samples were classified according to the relative expression of each pair of DE-RBP genes. The univariate Cox regression analysis and random forest were used to identify hub gene pairs to construct signature for predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer. Time -dependent ROC curves and KM survival curves were performed to evaluate the signature. GSEA was performed in TCGA training cohort and GSE62254 testing cohort to analyze enrich-ment pathways. Finally, the influence of these gene pairs on the prognosis of GC patients was further elucidated respectively through the combination of high and low expression of the two genes in each hub gene pair. Results: We screened out 6 hub RBP gene pairs (COL5A2/FEN1, POP1/GFRA1, EXO1/PLEKHS1, SLC39A10/CHI3L1, MMP7/PPP1R1 B and SLC5A6/BYSL) to predict the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Using the optimal cut-off value to divide patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in the training and testing cohort, we found that the overall survival (OS) of the low-risk group was higher than that of the high-risk group (P < 0.05). The area under the ROC curves for 1, 3, and 5 years were (0.659, 0.744, 0.758) and (0.624, 0.650, 0.653) in two cohorts. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that 6 RBP gene pairs signature were inde-pendent prognostic factors for gastric cancer (P < 0.05). In addition, the prognostic survival analysis showed that COL5A2-high/FEN1-low, POP1-low/GFRA1-high, EXO1-low/PLEKHS1-low, SLC39A10-high/CHI3L1-low, MMP7-high/PPP1R1 B-low, SLC5A6-low/BYSL-low had worse OS (P < 0.05). And the gene correlation analysis showed that there was no obvious correlation be-tween the genes in each gene pairs except SLC5A6/BYSL and POP1/GFRA1. Finally, GSEA analysis showed that the high-risk group was enriched in tumor migration, invasion and growth -related pathways.

Gastric cancer is a common cancer with high morbidity and mortality owing to most gastric cancers are discovered only at an advanced stage. Here, we aim to discover novel specific serum glycanbased biomarkers for gastric cancer. Methods: A lectin microarray with 50 kinds of tumor-associated lectin was used to detect the glycan profiles of serum samples between early gastric cancer and healthy controls. Then lectin blot was performed to validate the differences. Results: The result of the lectin microarray showed that the signal intensities of 13 lectins showed significant differences between the healthy controls and early gastric cancer. Compared to the healthy, the normalized fluorescent intensities of the lectins PWA, LEL, and STL were significantly increased, and it implied that their specifically recognized GlcNAc showed an especially elevated expression in early gastric cancer. Moreover, the binding affinity of the lectins EEL, RCA-II, RCA-I, VAL, DSA, PHA-L, UEA, and CAL were higher in the early gastric cancer than in healthy controls. These glycan structures containing GalNAc, terminal Gal beta 1-4 GlcNAc, Tri/tetraantennary N-glycan, beta-1, 6GlcNAc branching structure, alpha-linked fucose residues, and Tn antigen were elevated in gastric cancer. While the two lectins CFL GNL reduced their binding ability. In addition, their specifically recognized N-acetyl-D-galactosamine structure and (alpha-1,3) mannose residues were decreased in early gastric cancer. Furthermore, lectin blot results of LEL, STL, PHA-L, RCA-I were consistent with the results of the lectin microarray. Conclusions: The findings of our study clarify the specific alterations for glycosylation during the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.

The purpose of present study was to identify a serum microRNA (miRNA) expression profile that can serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for GC detection and to assess its clinical applications in monitoring disease progression. Methods: Serum samples were taken from 164 GC patients and 127 age- and gender-matched tumour-free controls. An initial screening of miRNA expression by Solexa sequencing was performed using serum samples pooled from 20 patients and 20 controls, respectively. Differential expression was validated using hydrolysis probe-based stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in individuals samples, the samples were arranged in two phases. Results: The Solexa sequencing results demonstrated that 19 serum miRNAs were markedly upregulated in the GC patients compared to the controls. The qRT-PCR analysis further identified a profile of five serum miRNAs (miR-1, miR-20a, miR-27a, miR-34 and miR-423-5p) as a biomarker for GC detection. The analysis results showed that the expression level of five serum miRNAs was correlated to tumour stage. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of this five-serum miRNA signature were 0.879 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.822-0.936) and 0.831 (95%. Cl 0.767-0.898) for the two sets of serum samples, respectively, markedly higher than those of the biomarkers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (0.503) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (0.600). Conclusions: We identified five-miRNA signature for GC diagnosis by genome-wide serum miRNA expression profiling. Expression levels of this serum miRNA-based biomarker also indicate tumour progression stages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Mar-11,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:18,,784-791,,5,47,,Eur.

To identify new biomarkers for early diagnosis of GC, the characteristics of gastric juice free amino acid (GJFAA) profiling was determined. Method: First, gastric juice was collected from 130 consecutive patients who underwent gastroscopy. They were divided into GC group (n = 47) and non-neoplastic gastric disease (NGD) group (n = 83) according to the pathological diagnosis. The concentrations of 34 GJFAAs were examined by amino acid analyzer. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used for comparing the alterations of GJFAA profiles between the two groups. Then candidate differential GJFAAs were verified by LC-MS/MS in another set of patients, which included 32 GC patients and 38 NGD patients. The diagnostic performance of GJFAAs was evaluated by ROC curve. Results: Significant alterations in GJFAA profiles were observed in GC patients compared to NGD patients in the training set. A total of 14 amino acids were screened as differential GJFAAs. Leucine, threonine and serine were the most frequently altered. Combined AUC of the three non-AAAs [0.869 (95% CI, 0.805-0.934)] was superior to the combined three AAAs [0.841 (95% CI, 0.773-0.908)]. In addition, a combined AUC comprisingthe six ones was further improved to 0.871 (95% CI, 0.809-0.933) in the diagnosis of GC. A similar variation trend and diagnostic value were observed in the validation set. Conclusion: This study indicates the potential of GJFAA profiling as a promising approach for the early detection and screening of GC.",2018,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:59,,,,5,11,,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 2323-2336 Place: 40 WHITE OAKS LN, MADISON, WI 53711 USA Publisher: IJCEP Copyright (c) 2018.

Objective: The objectives were to validate the effectiveness of risk-adapted sequential screening strategies in UGC preventionand control and assess the potential of sequential screening to lower mortality rates.Methods: Based on the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China, a prospective, large-scale cohort study based on popula-tion was conducted to recruit individuals from 4 cities in China from 2013-2019. Those identified as having a high risk ofUGC according to a validated risk-score model were advised to undergo endoscopy tests. Follow-up outcomes were trackeduntil June 2021. Incidence of UGC, UGC-related mortality, and all-cause mortality were evaluated between the screened andnonscreened cohorts. Results: The study included 153,079 participants at baseline. In total, 113,916 (74.42%) of the participants were designatedas low risk of UGC. The remaining 39,163 (25.68%) participants were deemed to be at high risk of UGC and were offeredgastroscopy tests. Among the high-risk participants, 9627 (compliance rate 24.6%) adhered to the gastroscopy tests. Over amedian follow-up of 6.05 (IQR 3.06-7.06) years, 622 UGC cases, 180 UGC deaths, and 1958 all-cause death cases weretraced. The screened cohort exhibited the highest cumulative incidence of UGC (119.2 per 100,000 person-years), followedby the nonscreened and low-risk cohorts. Obvious reductions in both all-cause mortality and UGC mortality were observedbetween those who undertook screening (153.7 and 4.7 per 100,000 person-years, respectively) and the nonscreened group(245.3 and 27 per 100,000 person-years, respectively). The screening population showed a significant 36% and 82% reductionin both all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.83, P<.001) and UGC mortality (HR 0.18, 95% CI0.04-0.74, P=.02), respectively, compared to the nonscreened group. Reductions of 35% in all-cause mortality (HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.49-0.86, P=.003) and 81% in UGC mortality (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.80, P=.02) were observed in participants agedolder than 55 years in the screened group compared to the nonscreened group. The reductions in all-cause mortality and UGCmortality were statistically significant in males (all-cause mortality: HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.88, P=.005; UGC mortality: HR0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.72, P=.02), but significant reductions were not observed in females (all P values were >.05). Conclusions: Our study suggests the significance of one-off risk-adapted UGC screening in reducing both all-cause mortalityand UGC mortality, particularly among high-risk individuals, indicating its effectiveness in UGC prevention and management.",2024,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,e62864,,e62864,10,,JMIR Public Health Surveill.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 13 Place: Toronto Publisher: Jmir Publications, Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:001343371800017",,,,"GASTRIC-CANCER; endoscopy; screening; upper gastrointestinal cancer; effectiveness, incidence, mortality, all-cause mortality; ESOPHAGEAL CANCER; 148",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peritoneal lavage cytology is usually diagnosed by microscopic findings; a diagnostic procedure using a liquid biopsy (LB) technique has not yet been established. Patients and Methods: We evaluated the feasibility of a LB approach using peritoneal lavage samples from 15 patients with gastric cancer. Samples were collected from both the Douglas pouch and the left subdiaphragmatic area, and cell-free DNA was extracted for analysis of TP53 mutations using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Results: All 10 patients with CY1 had positive cytology for the left subdiaphragmatic specimen. However, only six out of the 10 patients had positive cytology for their Douglas pouch specimens, and these six patients had peritoneal tumor DNA (ptDNA) in these specimens. In all five patients with CY0, ptDNA was not detected. The overall survival was significantly shorter in the ptDNA-positive group than in the ptDNA-negative group. The survival of the group with a high amount of DNA from free intraperitoneal cells (ficDNA) was significantly worse than that of those with a low amount. In contrast, the group with a high amount of DNA from peritoneal cell-free DNA (pcfDNA) had significantly better survival than the group with a low amount. Conclusion: LB cytology showed equivalent utility to that of conventional microscopic examinations regarding its diagnostic ability.

Detecting and treating at the premalignant stage has the potential to improve this. Helicobacter pylori is also a strong risk factor for this disease. Aims: Primary aims were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of magnified narrow band imaging (NBI-Z) endoscopy and serology in detecting normal mucosa, H. pylori gastritis and gastric atrophy. Secondary aims were to compare the diagnostic accuracies of two classification systems using both NBI-Z and white light endoscopy with magnification (WLE-Z) and evaluate the inter-observer agreement. Methods: Patients were prospectively recruited. Images of gastric mucosa were stored with histology and serum for IgG H. pylori and Pepsinogen (PG) I/II ELISAs. Blinded expert endoscopists agreed on mucosal pattern. Mucosal images and serological markers were compared with histology. Kappa statistics determined inter-observer variability for randomly allocated images among four experts and four non-experts. Results: 116 patients were prospectively recruited. Diagnostic accuracy of NBI-Z for determining normal gastric mucosa was 0.87(95%CI 0.82-0.92), H. pylori gastritis 0.65(95%CI 0.55-0.75) and gastric atrophy 0.88(95%CI 0.81-0.94). NBI-Z was superior to serology at detecting gastric atrophy: NBI-Z gastric atrophy 0.88(95%CI 0.81-0.94) vs PGI/II ratio < 3 0.74(95%CI 0.62-0.85) p<.0001. Overall NBI-Z was superior to WLE-Z in detecting disease using two validated classifications. Inter-observer agreement was 0.63(95%CI 0.51-0.73). Conclusions: NBI-Z accurately detects changes in the GI mucosa which currently depend on histology.

We report the first blinded comparative clinical trial in humans comparing a magnetically guided capsule endoscope (MGCE) and a conventional high-definition gastroscope. Objective: To assess the potential of gastric examination with a guided capsule. Design: Blinded, nonrandomized comparative study. Setting: Single endoscopy center. Methods: The trial involved 61 patients included in a blinded capsule and gastroscopy comparative study. MGCE examination was performed 24 hours after patients had undergone gastroscopy. To remove food residue or mucus, patients drank 900 mL. of water in 2 portions. Then to provide the air-water interface required by the guidance system, they drank 400 mL of water at 35 degrees C. Results: Visualization of the gastric pylorus, antrum, body, fundus, and cardia was evaluated as complete in 88.5%, 86.9%, 93.4%, 85.2%, and 88.5% of patients, respectively. Of gastric lesions, 58.3% were detected by both gastroscopy and MGCE at immediate assessment and review of recorded data. Capsule examination missed 14 findings and gastroscopy missed 31 findings seen with MGCE. Overall diagnostic yield was similar for both modalities. Limitation: Pilot study. Conclusions: Diagnostic results were similar for the 2 methods. After some technical difficulties related to gastric expansion or presence of mucus had been overcome, this study opened a new field for noninvasive gastric examination in countries where high gastric cancer incidence demands a screening tool.

We investigated chronological trends in gastric cancer detection rates based on individual characteristics and atrophic gastritis prevalence.; METHODS: Overall, 15,081 asymptomatic individuals aged ≥40 years without a medical history of gastric cancer underwent first-time esophagogastroduodenoscopy in our institute between February 2004 and December 2017. We retrospectively investigated individual characteristics and endoscopic diagnoses by period (early period: 2004-2007, middle period: 2008-2012, and late period: 2013-2017), clarified the long-term detection rate and the characteristics of endoscopic screening-detected gastric cancer, and evaluated the relationship between gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis.; RESULTS: Gastric cancer detection rates in the early, middle, and late periods were 1.01% (76/7,503, men/women: 4,360/3,143, average age: 59.4 years, prevalence of atrophic gastritis: 72%), 0.69% (40/5,820, men/women: 3,668/2,152, average age: 56.8 years, prevalence of atrophic gastritis: 48%), and 0.46% (8/1,758, men/women: 1,083/675, average age: 58.7 years, prevalence of atrophic gastritis: 37%), respectively.

Mortality and premature mortality in attenders were compared to nonattenders. Efficacy of screening was studied by 15 years' follow-up of standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and potential years of life lost (PYLL) due to gastric cancer. Bias due to selective attendance was quantified using corrective coefficients based on total cancer incidence and mortality, and gastric cancer-specific incidence and mortality for total population and nonattenders.Results: In 1994-1996, men aged 51-65 years (16,872) were invited to SPGI assay and 12,175 men (72%) attended. SPGI was 25 microg/l or less in 610 (5%) men, indicating severe atrophic gastritis (AG). Post-screening gastroscopy was performed to 435 men with low SPGI. Of these, 168 men were referred for treatment due to abnormal focal lesions. Attributable proportions in reductions of SMR and PYLL from gastric cancer due to screening were 59% and 67%. After correcting for selective participation, attributable proportions were reduced to 23% and 39%.Conclusions: Biomarker screening by low SPGI among middle-aged men followed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy decreased long-term and premature mortality due to gastric cancer.

The per-patient and per-lesion sensitivities of MCCG for superficial gastric neoplasia detection were 100% and 91.7%. Location and size of the lesions were compared favorably to gastroscopy whilst one cardiac lesion was missed. Endoscopic appearances of these lesions observed on MCCG and EGD demonstrated good consistency. No adverse events were observed. Conclusion: With good gastric preparation and careful examination of stomach, MCCG is able to detect superficial gastric neoplasms. (c) 2018 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Reports show that C5orf66-AS1, an antisense lncRNA, is expressed in various tumors. However, the role of C5orf66-AS1 in gastric cancer (GC) has not been fully clarified. The study focused on the expression patterns and serum level of C5orf66-AS1 in GC to explore its potential application in GC screening and diagnosis. The effects of C5orf66-AS1 on GC cells were also analyzed. Methods: Tissue and serum samples were used for RNA isolation. Expression levels of C5orf66-AS1 in GC tissues, serum, and cell lines were detected using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CCK-8, transwell, and wound healing assays were performed to determine the effects of C5orf66-AS1 on GC cell behavior. Results: C5orf66-AS1 expression was downregulated in GC cells compared to that in adjacent normal tissues. Serum C5orf66-AS1 levels were significantly lower in GC patients than in superficial gastritis (GS) and atrophic gastritis (GA) patients. Low serum expression of C5orf66-AS1 was associated with an increased risk of gastric dysplasia (GD) and GC. Receiver operating characteristic curve results showed that the area under curve (AUC) for GC was 0.688, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.5% and 53.6%, respectively. For the GD + early gastric cancer (ECG) group, the AUC was 0.789, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85.15% and 62.86%, respectively. Correlation analyses of clinicopathological parameters showed that serum C5orf66AS1 was predominantly associated with Lauren type, TNM stages, pTNM stages, and vessel tumor emboli. Additionally, in vitro overexpression of C5orf66-AS1 in AGS cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusion: Decreased expression levels of serum C5orf66-AS1 can be utilized for diagnosis of GC, especially for early diagnosis. The low level of serum C5orf66-AS1 indicated poor biological behavior of tumors in GC patients. In addition, C5orf66-AS1 can inhibit GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.",2020,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:04,,2795-2805,,,13,,OncoTargets Ther.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 11 Place: Albany Publisher: Dove Medical Press Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000522981500001,,,,RISK; PREVENTION; gastric cancer; CARCINOMA; early diagnosis; LONG NONCODING RNAS; long non-coding RNA; DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS; C5orf66-AS1; cell proliferation; migration and invasion; 629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article summarized the recent advances in liquid biopsy with a focus on novel technologies and the use of it in the screening, monitoring, and treatment of human GI cancer. Content: The concept of liquid biopsy was first used to define the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in cancer patients, and has been expanded to other biomarkers in blood and body fluids, such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), extracellular vesicles (EVs) and circulating tumor RNA. If analyzed with proper and advanced techniques like next generation sequencing (NGS) or proteomics, liquid biopsies can open an enormous array of potential biomarkers. The amount changes of target biomarkers and the mutation of genetic materials provide quantitative and qualitative information, which can be utilized clinically for cancer diagnosis and disease monitoring. Summary: As a highly efficient, minimally invasive, and cost-effective approach to diagnose and evaluate prognosis of GI cancer, liquid biopsy has lots of advantages over traditional biopsy and is promising in future clinical utility.

There have been reports which have investigated the usefulness of linked color imaging for assessing color values in endoscopy for early gastric cancer cases. However, these primarily focused on differentiated early gastric cancer. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of linked color imaging in analyzing the color differences between cancerous and noncancerous areas in undifferentiated-type early gastric cancer patients compared with conventional white light imaging. Methods: Forty-six patients were prospectively enrolled with undifferentiated-type early gastric cancer from 3 academic hospitals. All lesions were observed first by white light imaging followed by linked color imaging. An additional biopsy was taken from the surrounding mucosa to check for intestinal metaplasia, and test for Helicobacter pylori was performed. Color difference was measured in accordance with the International Commission on Illumination details. Results: The color difference value with linked color imaging was significantly higher, being more than twice that of white light imaging (26.82 +/- 14.18 and 12.60 +/- 6.42, P <.001), and this difference appeared to be similar in cases of accompanying Helicobacter pylori infection or intestinal metaplasia. In the subgroup analysis, color difference of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was notable in linked color imaging compared to white light imaging. Conversely, no statistically significant finding was present in signet ring cell carcinoma or mixed-type histology. Conclusion: Linked color imaging provides a significantly greater color difference between cancerous lesions and background noncancerous mucosa in undifferentiated-type early gastric cancer. Moreover, linked color imaging may differentiate between pathologic subgroups of undifferentiated-type early gastric cancer possibly due to characteristic cellular growth pattern.",Apr-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,356-363,,4,34,,Turk.

In the large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trial LCI-FIND, LCI demonstrated good diagnostic performance for the detection of tumor lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the present study was to exploratively evaluate the diagnostic performance of LCI according to H. pylori infection status as a subanalysis of LCI-FIND trial. Methods: The patients were randomly allocated to receive white light imaging (WLI) first, followed by LCI (WLI group), or vice versa (LCI group), and the two groups were compared for the detection of tumors. Data from this trial were analyzed by the presence/absence of H. pylori infection and further analyzed by successful or unsuccessful eradication in the H. pylori infection group. Results: The 752 patients in the WLI group and 750 patients in the LCI group who had participated in the LCI-FIND trial were included. In the successful eradication group, more gastric lesions were detected by primary mode in the LCI group than in the WLI group, indicating that more lesions were missed by WLI.

Although ESD is currently an alternative treatment in some countries, particularly in Asia, it remains uncertain whether ESD therapeutic outcomes in Western endoscopy settings can be comparable to those achieved in Japan. Objective: To evaluate the ESD therapeutic outcomes for differentiated early gastric cancer (EGC) in a Western endoscopy setting. Design/Setting: Consecutive case series performed by an expertly trained Western endoscopist. Patients: Fifty-three patients with 54 lesions. Interventions: ESD for early gastric cancers (T1) satisfying expanded inclusion criteria. Main Outcome Measurements: En bloc resection, en bloc tumor-free margin resection, and curative resection rates were 98%, 93%, and 83%, respectively. The delayed bleeding rate was 7%, and the perforation rate was 4%. Results: The mean patient age was 67 years, and the mean tumor size was 19.8mm, with 54% of the lesions located in the lesser curvature.

The occurrence of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in cancer-associated proteins is a key determinant for varied susceptibility of an individual towards cancer. Methodology: The study investigated the deleterious effects of these cancer-associated SNPs on the protein's structure, stability and cancer causing potential using an in silico approach. Numerous computational tools were employed that identified the most deleterious cancer-associated SNPs and those to get actively involved in post-translational modifications. The impact of these SNPs on the protein structure, function and stability was also examined. Conclusion and Future Scope: A total 63 non-synonymous SNPs in ITGAV gene were observed to be associated in these three gastrointestinal cancers and among this, 63, 19 were the most deleterious ones. The structural and functional importance of residues altered by most damaging SNPs was analyzed through evolutionary conservation and solvent accessibility. The study also elucidated three-dimensional structures of the 19 most damaging mutants. The analysis of conformational variation identified 5 SNPs (D379Y, G188E, G513V, L950P, and R540L) in integrin aV, which influence the protein's structure. Three calcium binding sites were predicted at residues: D379, G384 and G408 and a peptide binding site at residue: R369 in integrin aV. Therefore, SNPs D379Y, G384C, G408R and R369W have the potential to alter the binding properties of the protein. Screening and characterization of deleterious SNPs could advance novel biomarker discovery and therapeutic development in the future.",2021,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:00,,860-873,,6,24,,Comb. Chem.

However, the prognostic role of AS in gastric cancer is not clear and needs to be clarified. Material/Methods: To identify the differentially expressed AS (DEAS) events, we performed a differential expression analysis be- tween normal and tumor tissue. The DEAS event was further applied to construct a prognostic signature by performing univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the AS signature. In addition, the network of the splicing events with splicing factors was constructed using the Cytoscape software. Results: A total of 30 005 alternative splicing (AS) events with 372 patients were retrieved from the SpliceSeq database and TCGA database. By performing differential expression analysis, a total of 419 alternative splicing events were screened out, including 56 upregulated and 363 downregulated. We further constructed an AS-related prognostic signature by conducting a series bioinformatics analyses. Moreover, we identified that the AS signature could serve as an independent predictor for the prognosis of GC. We also found that AS signature had a more robust and precise efficacy for prognostic prediction in GC patients. Interestingly, the areas under 3-and 5-year survival curves are similar, both of which are greater than 1-year survival curve, suggesting that the long-term predictive accuracy of our prognostic model built upon AS signature is superior. Conclusions: We performed a comprehensive analysis of overall prognostic-associated AS events concerning GC and con- structed a prognostic model to predict the long-term prognostic survival outcomes in GC patients. We also developed a network of splicing events with splicing factors to reveal new potential molecular diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for GC patients.",2020/11/21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:01,,e925772,,e925772,26,,Med.

An Internet-based e-learning system to improve the ability of endoscopists to diagnose gastric cancer at an early stage was developed and was evaluated for its effectiveness. Methods: The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. After receiving a pre-test, participants were randomly allocated to either an e-learning or non-e-learning group. Only those in the e-learning group gained access to the e-learning system. Two months after the pre-test, both groups received a post-test. The primary endpoint was the difference between the two groups regarding the rate of improvement of their test results. Findings: 515 endoscopists from 35 countries were assessed for eligibility, and 332 were enrolled in the study, with 166 allocated to each group. Of these, 151 participants in the e-learning group and 144 in the non-e-learning group were included in the analysis. The mean improvement rate (standard deviation) in the e-learning and non-e-learning groups was 1.24 (0.26) and 1.00 (0.16), respectively (P < 0.001). Interpretation: This global study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of an e-learning system to expand knowledge and provide invaluable experience regarding the endoscopic detection of early gastric cancer (R000012039).

In this study, our goal was to further verify the expression profile of HSP27 in patients with GA. Methods: Western blot and immunohistochemistry were employed to determine HSP27 expression in 50 paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue. ELISA was used to quantify serum HSP27 concentrations in the same 50 GA patients and 50 healthy individuals. Results: Compared to adjacent normal tissues, HSP27 was over-expressed in 25 (50%, p = 0.000) and 24 (48%, p = 0.000) cases of GA tissue by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. ELISA revealed significantly higher serum concentrations of HSP27 in patients with GA patients (mean = 986 pg/mL) compared to healthy individuals (mean = 573 pg/mL) (p = 0.003). In addition, infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP) in healthy individuals was associated with increased expression of HSP27 in both gastric mucosa and serum. Conclusions: These data suggest that HSP27 is over-expressed in GA tissue and serum concentrations of HSP27 are increased in patients with GA. Over-expression of HSP27 may indicate a gastric malignant/infectious process. The detection of serum HSP27 concentrations by ELISA may be useful for screening for GA.

Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the newly expanded criteria of ESD for EGCs. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies published between January 1, 2010 and July 10, 2014. These studies were collected by 2 authors and then analyzed with RevMan 5.0. Results: Six studies including 6,687 patients were identified. Compared to the standard group (SG), the expanded group (EG) had higher bleeding (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.02-2.68), perforation (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.25-3.31), positive lateral margin rates (OR 16.88; 95% CI 3.83-74.5) and lower en bloc resection rate (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.34-0.70). The local recurrence (OR 2.46; 95% CI 0.31-19.23) and total survival rates (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.761.12) between the 2 groups were not statistically different. Conclusions: Considering the similar rates of local recurrence and total survival between the SG and EG, the use of ESD for the management of EGCs that meet the expanded criteria could be considered a safe and effective treatment method.

Methods: The mechanism of ITIH4 elevation in gastric cancer cells was investigated via Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) with or without recombinant human interleukin-6 (rhIL-6) in human gastric cell line AGS cells. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of ITIH4 and IL-6 in AGS cells were detected with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while the expression of ITIH4 protein and IL-6 in AGS cells was detected with Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Results: We found that the mRNA and protein expressions of ITIH4 started to increase synchronously at 3 hours (h), peaked at 12 h, and then declined to normal a level at 24 h in AGS cells after H. pylori infection. Interestingly, the expression patterns of ITIH4 were positively correlated to IL-6 expression levels. In the ITIH4 expression experiment with IL-6 administration, the expression level of ITIH4 began to increase at a concentration of 6.25 ng/mL with rhIL-6 administration, reach a peak, and plateau at a concentration of 25 ng/mL of rhIL-6. The expression patterns of ITIH4 in AGS cells induced by H. pylori infection were closely related to the infection of H. pylori and the level of IL-6. Conclusions: The detection of ITIH4 and IL-6 during H. pylori infection may be useful for the screening of early gastric cancer.",Aug-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:02,,4656-4665,,8,9,,Transl.

The implications of CDHI mutations detected with multigene panels in those without family history of HDGC are uncertain. Methods: A registry of patients who underwent genetic counseling for CDHI mutation was queried for the period 2011-2017. Results: Twenty-one patients with CDHI mutation were identified. The most common indication for CDH1 genetic screening was family history of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (known risk) in 10 patients (48%); 11 patients (52%), however, were diagnosed by multigene cancer panels (unknown risk). Nine of the 21 patients underwent total gastrectomy, and 5 others had metastatic gastric cancer at presentation. In the gastrectomy group, 5 of the 9 patients (56%) were known to have gastric cancer based on preoperative screening endoscopy, but final pathologic examinations indicated diffuse gastric cancer in 8 of the 9 patients. The 11 patients with unknown risk for CDHI mutation tended to be older (median 41 vs 24 years) and more likely to have metastatic disease and to die of the disease (43% vs 29%) compared with patients with family history of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Conclusion: CDH1 mutation-associated hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is a biologically aggressive variant of gastric cancer that appears to behave similarly in patients detected only by multigene panels. The detection of CDH1 mutation at a minimum warrants genetic counseling and preferably total gastrectomy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, several factors, such as heterogeneity in protein expression, shortage of evaluable tumour tissue and need for quick target assessment, underline the usefulness of a pre-screening tool in order to anticipate HER2 status. METHODS: Data from 723 consecutive GOC analysed for HER2 at four Italian Institutions were collected. HER2 positivity was defined as 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ with gene amplification by in situ hybridisation (ISH). A multivariate logistic regression model was built using data from 413 cases, whereas 310 patients served as validation cohort. C-index, visual inspection of the calibration plot, Brier score and Spiegelhalter z-test were used to assess the performance of the nomogram. RESULTS: HER2 positive rate was 17.4%. Four variables were retained after adjustment in the final model: grading, Lauren's histotype, pathologic material analysed (surgical specimen/biopsy) and site of tissue collection (primary tumour/metastases). Visual inspection of the calibration plot revealed a very good overlap between predicted and observed probabilities, with a Brier score of 0.101 and a non-significant Spiegelhalter z-test (P = 0.319).

Aim: To identify subgroups of differing cancer risk after endoscopic mucosal resection of early gastric cancer. Methods: Histological assessment of antral and corpus tissue was done by the updated Sydney Classification and serum pepsinogen I and II levels were measured using ELISA kits. Infected patients were treated with a 7-day regimen consisting of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and a proton pump inhibitor. Results: 100 patients were enrolled; in 80 patients H. pylori was successfully eradicated and they were followed up for more than 2 years (median observation period 33 months). Metachronous gastric cancers developed in 9 patients after successful eradication. All cases were men. The frequency of severe atrophy assessed by histology (100 vs. 53.2%, p = 0.03) was higher and pepsinogen I/II ratio before eradication was significantly lower in the group that developed cancer compared to the group that did not. Pepsinogen I < 25 ng/ml was significantly associated with development of a new lesion. Conclusions: The cancer risk after eradication correlated with the severity of corpus atrophy. It should be possible to identify subgroups requiring intensive and less intensive surveillance after eradication. Copyright (c) 2008 S.

Recently it has been found that X-ray examination for gastric cancer screening does not have much effect on the detection rate for gastric cancer in Japan. A candidate for a new mass screening for gastric cancer, the ABC method, using the combination assay of Hp and serum pepsinogen, was useful for identifying the development of gastric cancer in high-risk and low risk populations. People with higher cancer risk are recommended to receive endoscopy. The ABC method was carried out as a gastric cancer mass-screening on the initiative of Nishitokyo Medical Association in Nishitokyo city from 2011. This paper reviewed the present status of gastric cancer screening using the ABC method, including the latest results of our ongoing screening. Summary: We report results for 36,627 individuals from 2011 to 2013. Among them, 16,965 received blood examination for the ABC method. Of those, 8,083 planned to undergo endoscopic examination according to stratification of the risk for the development of gastric cancer. In fact, a total of 2,911 individuals underwent endoscopic examination. Gastric cancer was detected in 65 patients, including 52 (80%) diagnosed with early gastric cancer. The ABC method was not organized screening but opportunistic screening. X-ray examination was the organized screening that was ongoing during the same period. Detection cost for 1 gastric cancer case using the ABC method was cheaper than the conventional X-ray screening method ((sic)1,267,452 vs. (sic)2,807,763). Key Messages: Although further large epidemiological studies are required, the ABC method might be positioned as an effective mass screening for gastric cancer. (C) 20165.

Early detection and diagnosis of gastric cancer in the stomach is important for improving the prognosis of gastric cancer. This retrospective study was designed to investigate the value of magnifying narrow-band imaging (NBI) in the diagnosis of precancerous lesions and early gastric cancer. Methods: This study included 122 patients who were diagnosed with early gastric cancer or precancerous gastric lesions by endoscopy. The patients underwent an examination with conventional endoscopy, magnifying NBI, and magnifying chromoendoscopy. Images resolution was evaluated, and the morphology, pit patterns and blood capillary forms of lesions were analyzed. The presence of gastric carcinoma and high grade intraepithelial neoplasia in the biopsy samples was considered as a positive pathological result, which is used to assess accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis. Results: For image resolution, magnifying NBI and magnifying chromoendoscopy were significantly superior to magnifying conventional endoscopy in morphology, pit pattern and blood capillary form (P < 0.01), and magnifying NBI was significantly superior to magnifying chromoendoscopy in blood capillary form (P < 0.01). IV, V-1, and VI type of gastric pit pattern were detected in 14 cases, 43 cases, and 17 cases in patients with high grade intraepithelial neoplasia, respectively. V-1 and VI type of gastric pit pattern were detected in 9 cases and 39 cases in patients with early gastric cancer, respectively. The presence of irregular minute vessels and variation in the caliber of vessels was found in 109 cases. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate and false negative rate for diagnosis of early gastric cancer and precancerous gastric lesions were 68.9%, 95.1%, 63.1%, 24.5%, and 32.4% for conventional endoscopy, 93.6%, 92.7%, 94.5%, 5.7%, and 6.9% for magnifying NBI, and 91.3%, 88.6%, 93.2%, 13.2%, and 21.48% for magnifying chromoendoscopy, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that magnifying NBI is superior to conventional endoscopy in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer and precancerous gastric lesions, and can be used for screening early malignancies of the stomach.",2011/12/14,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/24 16:32,,135,,1,11,,BMC Gastroenterol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 7 Place: London Publisher: BMC Web of Science ID: WOS:000299113100001 TLDR: It is demonstrated that magnifying NBI is superior to conventional endoscopy in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer and precancerous gastric lesions, and can be used for screening early malignancies of the stomach.",,,,1145; CHROMOENDOSCOPY; FEATURES; MAGNIFICATION ENDOSCOPY; PATTERN; PROGNOSIS; SYSTEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of new biomarkers that can be utilized in the early diagnosis of GC is a pressing need. This present study assessed centrosomal protein-55 (CEP55)' serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1) and sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3) genes and proteins in gastric adenocarcinoma with different tumor progression features. Thirty surgically resected gastric tissue samples from thirty patients suffered from gastric cancers were obtained. The gastric tissue samples were divided into tumorous (with different stages and grades) and adjacent non-tumorous samples. CEP55, SERPINE1 and SMPD3 genes were assessed by quantitative qRT-PCR, and their proteins were assessed by ELISA in the gastric tissue samples. Results: As regards SERPINE1, CEP55 genes and proteins, results revealed significant elevations in the GC samples (p < 0.0001). On the contrary, SMPD3 gene and protein revealed significant decreases as compared to non-tumorous samples. The studied genes and proteins showed highly significant specificity and sensitivity in the early detection of GC. SERPINE1 gene and protein revealed highly significant increases and positive correlations, while SMPD3 gene and protein revealed highly significant decreases and negative correlations as the tumor progresses. Conclusion: CEP55, SERPINE1 and SMPD3 genes and proteins could be used as useful biomarkers for the early detection of GC.

However, their sensitivity and specificity are unsatisfactory. Therefore, we assessed the novel tumor marker DR-70 and evaluated its performance in screening and response monitoring. Methods: The study included newly diagnosed patients with advanced gastric cancer from March 2012 to October 2015. We measured the DR-70, CEA, and CA 19-9 levels at the time of enrollment. The patients subsequently underwent chemotherapy. We followed-up the patients every 3 months; DR-70 levels and abdominal computed tomography scans were re-evaluated and repeated, respectively, at each follow-up. The correlation between treatment response and DR-70 level after chemotherapy was analyzed. The overall survival and progression-free survival rates were also evaluated. Results: A total of 51 patients with gastric cancer were enrolled. Most (82.4%) had metastatic disease. At enrollment, the sensitivity of DR-70 in our study group was 78.4%, compared with 52.9% and 43.1% for CEA and CA 19-9, respectively. When we used the three tumor markers together, the sensitivity increased to 80.4%. We observed a correlation between treatment response and DR-70 level after chemotherapy. No difference in either overall survival or progression-free survival was observed between the DR-70 positive and negative groups. However, a trend toward poorer overall survival was observed for the high DR-70 group, although this was not statistically significant. Conclusion: DR-70 is a powerful tool not only for screening unresectable gastric cancer but also for treatment response evaluation. Copyright (C) 2018, the Chinese Medical Association.

Biomarkers for screening and prevention of gastric cancer are missing. Changes in peripheral blood mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have emerged as a potential preventive/diagnosis biomarker for cancer risk. We aimed to determine whether peripheral leukocytes mtDNA levels are associated with stages of the gastric carcinogenesis cascade. Methods: We measured mtDNA by quantitative real-time PCR assay in peripheral leukocytes of 28 patients with non-atrophic gastritis (NAG), 74 patients with gastric cancer, and 48 matched asymptomatic controls. In parallel, the serologic level of IL8 was determined. Results: Mean mtDNA level was higher in patients with gastric cancer (P = 0.0095) than in controls, with values >8.46 significantly associated with gastric cancer (OR, 3.93). Three ranges of mtDNA values were identified: interval I, <2.0; interval II, 2.0-20; and interval III, >20. Interval I included mainly NAG cases, and few gastric cancer samples and interval III corresponded almost exclusively to patients with gastric cancer. All controls fell in interval II, together with some NAG and gastric cancer cases. IL8 levels were significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer (P < 0.05), with levels >50 pg/mL observed exclusively in patients with gastric cancer, allowing to distinguish them within interval II. We validated mtDNA results in a second cohort of patients, confirming that mtDNA was significantly higher in gastric cancer than in patients with preneoplasia. Conclusions: Circulating levels of mtDNA and IL8 constitute a potential biomarker for the early detection of gastric cancer. Impact: Our findings lead us to propose a new noninvasive method to detect patients with gastric cancer risk.

This study aims to identify potential druggable target biomarkers as potential therapeutic options for patients with gastric cancer. Methods: Immunohistochemistry of human gastric tumor tissues was conducted to determine the expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12). Multiple in vitro and in vivo assays such as RNAi, mass spectrometry, computer docking models, kinase assays, cell xenograft NU/NU mouse models (CDXs) and patient-derived xenograft NOD/SCID mouse models (PDXs) were conducted to study the function and molecular interaction of CDK12 with p21 activated kinase 2 (PAK2), as well as to find CDK12 inhibitors as potential treatment options for human gastric cancer. Results: Here we identified that CDK12 is a driver gene in human gastric cancer growth. Mechanistically, CDK12 directly binds to and phosphorylates PAK2 at T134/T169 to activate MAPK signaling pathway. We further identified FDA approved clinical drug procaterol can serve as an effective CDK12 inhibitor, leading to dramatic restriction of cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in human gastric cancer cells and PDXs.

Serum pepsinogen is a biomarker for atrophic gastritis, a gastric cancer precursor, and may be useful to detect persons at increased risk of gastric cancer. Methods: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was conducted in the United States between 1993 and 2001. ELISA-based pepsinogen tests were conducted on prediagnostic serum samples of 105 PLCO participants who developed gastric cancer and 209 age, sex, and race-matched controls. Pepsinogen positive (PG+) was defined as pepsinogen I & LE; 70 mg/L and pepsinogen I/II ratio & LE;3.0. Results of conditional logistic regression models, and sensitivity and specificity, of PG+ for gastric cancer are reported. Results: Gastric cancer cases were more likely to be PG+ (31.4% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.001) at baseline than controls. Compared to PG-, PG+ was associated with an 8.5-fold increased risk for gastric cancer [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.8-19.4]. This risk remained significant after adjusting for Helicobacter pylori , family history of gastric cancer, education, smoking, and BMI (aOR, 10.6; 95% CI, 4.3-26.2). In subgroup analysis, PG+ individuals were 11-fold more like to develop non-cardia gastric cancer (OR, 11.1; 95% CI, 4.3-28.8); conversely, they were not significantly more likely to develop cardia gastric cancer (OR, 2.0; 95% CI = 0.3-14.2). PG+ status yielded low sensitivity but high specificity for both noncardia (44.3%; 93.6%) and cardia gastric cancer (5.7%; 97.2%). Conclusions: Prediagnostic serum pepsinogen levels from a large, prospective cohort study were associated with risk of gastric cancer, particularly noncardia gastric cancer. Impact: PG status may identify individuals at higher risk of noncardia gastric cancer for targeted screening or interventions.See related commentary by Zhou and Huang, p. 1257",Jul-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,1426-1432,,7,31,,Cancer Epidemiol.

Finding effective diagnostic biomarkers in urine or serum would represent the most ideal solution to detecting gastric cancer during annual physical examination. This study was to evaluate the potential of endothelial lipase (EL) as a urinary biomarker for diagnosis of gastric cancer. Methods: The expression levels of EL was measured using Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining experiments on (tissue, serum, and urine) samples of gastric cancer patients versus healthy people. We also checked the EL levels in the urine samples of other cancer types (lung, colon and rectum cancers) and benign lesions (gastritis and gastric leiomyoma) to check if EL was specific to gastric cancer. Result: We observed a clear separation between the EL expression levels in the urine samples of 90 gastric cancer patients and of 57 healthy volunteers. It was approximately 9.9 fold average decrease of the EL expression levels in the urine samples of gastric cancer compared to the healthy controls (P <0.0001), achieving a 0.967 AUC value for the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve, demonstrating it's highly accurate as a diagnostic marker for gastric cancer. Interestingly, the expression levels of EL in tissue and serum samples were not nearly as discriminative as in urine samples (P = 0.90 and P = 0.79). In immunohistochemical experiments, positive expression of the EL protein was found in 67% (8/12) of gastric adjacent noncancerous and in 58% (7/12) of gastric cancer samples. There was no significant statistical in the expression levels of this protein between the gastric cancer and the matching noncancerous tissues (P =0.67). Conclusions: The urinary EL as a highly accurate gastric cancer biomarker that is potentially applicable to the general screening with high sensitivity and specificity.",2013/3/19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:17,,45,,1,8,,Diagn.

Recent studies have shown that microRNAs play crucial roles in regulating cellular proliferation process in gastric cancer. MicroRNA-29c (miR-29c) acts as a tumor suppressor in different kinds of tumors. Methods: Quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate miR-29c expression level in 67 patient gastric cancer tissues and 9 gastric cancer cell lines. The effects of miR-29c were explored by proliferation assay, soft agar colony formation assay, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. The target gene was predicted by bioinformatic algorithms and validated by dual luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis. Results: In this study, we demonstrate that miR-29c is down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. We indicate that overexpression of miR-29c inhibits cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis and arrests cell cycle at G1/G0 phase. We additionally show that miR-29c exerts these effects by targeting Nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP). Moreover, depletion of NASP can elite the phenotypes caused by miR-29c.

A validation set of 70 pairs of gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues were examined to confirm the expression levels of the potential biomarkers identified by iTRAQ labeling. Results: We detected 431 proteins associated with 16 KEGG pathways that were differentially expressed in gastric cancer tissues, of which 224 were upregulated and 207 were downregulated in gastric cancer tissues.

Presence of new sensitive and specific biomarkers for early detection and progression of GC could lead to reduction in the mortality rate. In addition to intracellular miRNAs, circulating miRNAs reflect the state of cancer progression and might be potential biomarkers for rapid detection and also therapy in GC. Objective: After giving a brief explanation about circulating miRNAs and their various types, we then reviewed comprehensively the last studies which investigated circulating miRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers in GC. Methods: Research and review articles in PubMed and Scopus databases were summarized. Keywords mainly used were in related to circulating miRNAs and their diagnostic and prognostic value in gastric cancer. Among the numerous circulating miRNAs a comparison was made based on their repeatability, specificity and sensitivity. Results: Comparisons indicated high diagnostic value of circulating miRNAs in comparison with other detection methods based on their high sensitivity and specificity. There was also a relation between altered expression level of large number of circulating miRNAs and clinicopathological factors and also response to therapy in GC. Conclusion: Several advantages of circulating miRNAs as detection biomarker have led to extensive studies and significant advances. Altered expression pattern of circulating miRNAs have correlation with pathological status of GC tissues and their exclusive features make them ideal early diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers for GC.",2018,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:09,,698-714,,6,25,,Curr.

A subset of gastric cancers demonstrates an inherited genetic predisposition. Individuals with germline mutations in the CDH1 gene incur a lifetime risk for diffuse gastric cancer and benefit from prophylactic gastrectomy. The results for this operative intervention remain relatively undescribed in the literature, despite guidelines supporting its use. Methods: We present a single-institution series of patients with confirmed CDH1 mutations who underwent gastrectomy. We describe their presenting symptoms, preoperative screening, clinicopathologic features, and outcomes. Focal outcomes of interest are weight loss and postoperative morbidity. Results: Between 2010 and 2018, ten patients with a confirmed CDH1 mutation underwent total gastrectomy with intestinal pouch reconstruction at our institution. Two patients had clinical gastric cancer at the time of their operation at 21 and 60 y of age. Eight patients had prophylactic gastrectomy. All prophylactic patients had undergone prior endoscopic screening without detection of cancer; however, three had occult gastric cancer on pathological examination. Median weight loss after gastrectomy was 10 kg at 6 mo and 11 kg at 1 y. Postoperative morbidity was limited to one anastomotic leak, one hematoma, and one case of pneumonia. All patients remain disease-free with median follow-up of 19 mo. Conclusions: Total gastrectomy for patients with a CDH1 mutation is a cancer-preventing operation for a high-risk population. For this series, jejunal pouch reconstruction was performed with encouragingly low postoperative morbidity, weight loss, and good subjective function. (C) 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to assess whether the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) can improve the detection rate of early gastric cancer (EGC). Methods: The detection rate of EGC at the Digestive Endoscopy Center, Affiliated Hospital, Zunyi Medical College, China between September 2013 and September 2015 was analyzed. MDT for the diagnosis of EGC in the hospital was established in September 2014. The study was divided into 2 time periods: September 1, 2013 to August 31, 2014 (period 1) and September 1, 2014 to September 1, 2015 (period 2). Results: A total of 60,800 patients' gastroscopies were performed during the two years. 61 of these patients (0.1%) were diagnosed as EGC, accounting for 16.44% (61/371) of total patients with gastric cancer. The EGC detection rate before MDT (period 1) was 0.05% (16/29403), accounting for 9.09% (16/176) of total patients with gastric cancer during this period.

Survivin, an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein, is associated with the initiation and progression of gastric cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression patterns of survivin and its relationship with early diagnosis of gastric cancer in Iranian patients.Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, immunoexpression of survivin was investigated on sections obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 38 chronic gastritis, 32 intestinal metaplasia, 20 dysplasia, 28 gastric adenocarcinoma, and 22 controls.Results: Survivin immunoexpression in chronic gastritis was higher than controls, but this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, survivin immunoexpression had a steady significant increase from control and chronic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia to dysplasia to gastric adenocarcinoma (P < 0.05). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of survivin immunohistochemical test for the diagnosis of gastric cancer were 87.5%, 74.4%, and 0.85, respectively. Males had a significantly higher survivin expression than females (P < 0.001). Also, survivin expression was significantly higher in older patients than in younger ones (P < 0.001).Conclusion: It seems that the steady increase in survivin expression from different precancerous lesions to gastric adenocarcinoma suggests that survivin can be used as a potential biomarker for the prevention and early diagnosis of gastric cancer.",Mar-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,52-58,,1,39,,Int.

Early-stage diagnosis of gastric cancer is highly challenging because the patients either exhibit symptoms similar to stomach infections or show no signs at all. Biomarkers are active players in the cancer process by acting as indications of aberrant alterations due to malignancy.Objective: Though there have been significant advancements in the biomarkers and therapeutic targets, there are still insufficient data to fully eradicate the disease in its early phases. Therefore, it is crucial to identify particular biomarkers for detecting and treating stomach cancer. This review aims to provide a thorough overview of data analysis in gastric cancer.Methods: Text mining, network analysis, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and structural bioinformatics approaches have been employed in this study.Results: We have built a huge interaction network in the current study to forecast new biomarkers for gastric cancer. The four putatively unique and potential biomarker genes have been identified via a large association network in this study.Conclusion: The molecular basis of the illness is well understood by computational approaches, which also provide biomarkers for targeted cancer therapy. These putative biomarkers may be useful in the early detection of disease. This study also shows that in H. pylori infection in early-stage gastric cancer, the top 10 hub genes constitute an essential component of the epithelial cell signaling pathways.

The initiation and progression of gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) is controlled by both genetic and epigenetic events. Epigenetic alterations, including changes in DNA methylation, specific histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and noncoding RNA-mediated gene silencing, are potentially reversible and heritable.; SUMMARY: In this article, we summarize the current advances in epigenetic biomarkers as potential substrates for GIC detection. The combined screening of a panel of methylated genes, hyperacetylated histones, microRNAs or other noncoding RNAs is currently under evaluation to improve sensitivity.; KEY MESSAGE: Current studies concentrated on the development of cost-effective epigenetic diagnostic biomarkers for GIC based on noninvasive blood or stool samples. The combined blood or stool test with a relatively high sensitivity could be a cost-effective screening tool for the detection of patients with asymptomatic cancers who could therefore choose whether or not to go for further examinations, such as endoscopy or colonoscopy.; PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: A better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms has not only offered new insights into a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis, but has also allowed identification of clinically relevant putative biomarkers for the early detection, disease monitoring, prognosis and risk assessment of GIC. In particular, noninvasive biomarkers in serum or fecal samples for the detection of GIC could have potential for better compliance and can be incorporated into routine clinical practice in the foreseeable future, pending their validation in large-scale prospective trials.",2015,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:58,,,,4,1,,Gastrointest.

By evaluating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance in Singaporean Chinese, this study aimed to inform the implementation of such a program in a population with a low to intermediate GC risk. Methods: Using a reference strategy of no OGD intervention, we evaluated four strategies: 2-yearly OGD surveillance, annual OGD surveillance, 2-yearly OGD screening and 2-yearly screening plus annual surveillance in Singaporean Chinese aged 50-69 years. From a perspective of the healthcare system, Markov models were built to simulate the life experience of the target population. The models projected discounted lifetime costs ($), quality adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating the cost-effectiveness of each strategy against a Singapore willingness-to-pay of $46,200/QALY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to identify the influential variables and their associated thresholds, and to quantify the influence of parameter uncertainties respectively. Results: With an ICER of $44,098/QALY, the annual OGD surveillance was the optimal strategy while the 2-yearly surveillance was the most cost-effective strategy (ICER = $25,949/QALY). The screening-based strategies were either extendedly dominated or cost-ineffective. The cost-effectiveness heterogeneity of the four strategies was observed across age-gender subgroups. Eight influential parameters were identified each with their specific thresholds to define the choice of optimal strategy. Accounting for the model uncertainties, the probability that the annual surveillance is the optimal strategy in Singapore was 44.5%. Conclusion: Endoscopic surveillance is potentially cost-effective in the prevention of GC for populations at low to intermediate risk. Regarding program implementation, a detailed analysis of influential factors and their associated thresholds is necessary. Multiple strategies should be considered in order to recommend the right strategy for the right population.",2013/12/27,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:16,,e83959,,12,8,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000329117900069,,,,FOLLOW-UP; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI; LESIONS; INTESTINAL METAPLASIA; SERUM PEPSINOGEN; COHORT; CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES; UTILITY ANALYSIS; CHINESE POPULATION; SINGAPORE; 1087,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early detection is highly crucial for improving prognosis. The incidence of GC is very high in countries, like India, due to the limitations among the established biomarkers for GC owing to poor sensitivity and specificity. Objective: This study aimed to identify the novel biomarkers from serum samples obtained from GC patients compared to healthy subjects. Methods: Serum samples from GC patients were analyzed by two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (2DGE) coupled with tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS), including both Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-ToF) and Liquid Chromatography-MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Identified proteins were further analyzed by gene ontology and protein interaction studies. Results: A total of 73 protein spots were detected in 2DGE image analysis. Among them, seven differentially-expressed proteins were identified using MS analyses, including serotransferrin/ transferrin, albumin, ceruloplasmin, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen gamma-chain (FGG), and two unreported novel proteins, immunoglobulin kappa constant (Ig kappa C) region and Homo sapiens zinc finger protein 28 (ZNF28) homolog. Among these proteins, serotransferrin, albumin, ceruloplasmin, FGG, and ZNF28 were down-regulated in GC samples (p<0.05), while Ig kappa C region and CRP were up-regulated significantly. Conclusion: Most of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in angiogenesis, plasminogen-activating cascade, and blood coagulation pathways which are known to play a critical role in gastric tumorigenesis.

Early detection is a key factor to reduce its mortality. Methods: We retrospectively collected pre- and postoperative serum samples as well as tumour tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 100 GC patients. Serum samples from non-cancerous patients were served as controls (n = 50). A high-throughput protein detection technology, multiplex proximity extension assays (PEA), was applied to measure levels of over 300 proteins. Alteration of each protein was analysed by univariate analysis. Elastic-net logistic regression was performed to select serum proteins into the diagnostic model. Findings: We identified 19 serum proteins (CEACAM5, CA9, MSLN, CCL20, SCF, TGF-alpha, MMP-1, MMP-10, IGF-1, CDCPI, PPIA, DDAH-1, HMOX-1, FLI1, IL-7, ZBTB-17, APBB1IP, KAZALD-1, and ADAMTS-15) that together distinguish GC cases from controls with a diagnostic sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 100%, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-1). Moreover, the 19-serum protein signature pro-vided an increased diagnostic capacity in patients at TNMI-II stage (sensitivity 89%, specificity 100%, AUC 0.99) and in patients with high miaosatellite instability (MSI) (91%. 98%, and 0.99) compared to individual proteins. These promising results will inspire a large-scale independent cohort study to be pursued for validating the proposed protein signature. Interpretation: Based on targeted proteomics and elastic-net logistic regression, we identified a 19-serum protein signature which could contribute to clinical GC diagnosis, especially for patients at early stage and those with high MSI.

Methods: We carried out a retrospective study on the expression of 32 genes, selected for their proven or potential links to GC, on historic formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) GC specimens from our unit. Gene expression was measured using quantitative nuclease protection assays (qNPA) technology. Following statistical analysis of the results, immunohistochemical staining for eight genes, both discriminating and nondiscriminating, was conducted in seven age and sex matched non-metastatic: metastatic GC pairings. The stained samples were reviewed by two blinded consultant histopathologists. Results: Multivariate Cox analysis of the gene expression data revealed metastatic status, age, sex and five genes appeared to influence GC survival. Genes negatively influencing survival included BCAS1, P53 and HSP90AA1 (relative risks 2.20, 3.73 and 7.53 respectively). Genes conveying survival benefit included CASP3 and TERT (relative risks 0.10 and 0.24 respectively). Immunohistochemical staining of seven age and sex matched non-metastatic: metastatic pairs revealed no association between gene expression and protein expression. Conclusions: Our study found several genes whose expression may affect GC prognosis. However, immunohistochemical analysis revealed no association between gene expression and protein expression. It remains to be determined whether gene expression or protein expression are reliable means of assessing GC prognosis.",Apr-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,303-310,,2,9,,J. Gastrointest.

Since development is usually asymptomatic, it is generally diagnosed at an advanced stage. The value of screening in patients with nonspecific symptoms for GC is controversial. AIM: The study aimed to evaluate whether hematological parameters (platelet count (PC), mean platelet volume (MPV), MPV/PC ratio, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR)) are useful markers to differentiate between gastric cancer patients and healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with gastric cancer and sixty-one healthy individuals were enrolled to the survey and a retrospective analysis of selected blood parameters was performed. RESULTS: The mean values of PC, MPV, RDW, NLR, and PLR were significantly higher in GC patients compared to the control group. No statistical differences were observed in MPV/PC ratios. Likewise, no significant statistical differences were revealed in values of blood parameters among TNM stage groups. The RDW showed the highest diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Hematological parameters: PC, MPV, RDW, NLR, PLR have diagnostic power and can discriminate patients with gastric cancer from patients without cancer. Blood parameters compared with clinical symptoms might alert physicians and patients and lead to performancce of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the gold standard in gastric cancer screening and thereby increase the early detection of cancer.",2016,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:57,,,,9,17,,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 4433-4437 Place: Thailand Web of Science ID: 27797257,,,,1329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A reliable diagnostic tool for the early detection of GC is essential. Objective: We previously suggested a pepsinogen test method to reduce the mortality from GC by allowing early detection. Here, we report an updated analysis from a prospective single-center clinical study to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the pepsinogen test method and to determine whether this test can be used as a part of routine laboratory assessment of high-risk patients. Methods: We present mature data of the pepsinogen test method in the Croatian population after a median follow-up of 36 months. Statistical analyses were performed using a Mann-Whitney U test, multiple logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to evaluate the predictive power of the assayed biomarkers. Results: Of the 116 patients, 25 patients had GC and 91 demonstrated a nonmalignant pathology based on tissue biopsy. Cutoff values were pepsinogen I <= 70 and pepsinogen I/II ratio <= 3.0.

Recent advances in molecular regulation of cancer suggest the prominence of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the multistep process of tumourigenesis. Summary: CircRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs, abundant in eukaryotes, with key roles in regulating genes and miRNAs as well as the alteration of processes involved in pathological conditions. Research studies have demonstrated the participation of circRNAs in the initiation and progression of tumours.

Previous studied showed that miR-215 was involved in tumorigenesis and progression. This study was designed to clarify the biological function of miR-215 in GC. Methods: qRT-PCR was used to detect the miR-215 expression in GC tissues and 6 human GC cell lines (AGS, SGC-7901, NCI-N87, GES-1, MKN-45 and BGC-823) as well. Transwell assay was used to investigate the biological function of miR-215 in GC. Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm its effect on the regulation of the target gene Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene 1 (RB1). Results: miR-215 was frequently up-regulated in GC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and GC cell lines. miR-215 expression level was correlated with the progression of tumor invasion and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Over-expression miR-215 in GC cell lines promoted cell migration and invasion. Besides, miR-215 could down-regulate the expression of RB1 in vitro via directly binding to its 3'-untranslated region (UTR), while the expression of RB1 would suppress the miR-215-indueced GC cell migration and invasion. Conclusions: miR-215 promoted cell migration and invasion of gastric cancer by directly targeting RB1. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

However, if diagnosed at an early stage, it can be cured by endoscopic treatment and has a good prognosis. While gastrointestinal X-ray and upper endoscopy are used as national GC screening methods in some GC high-risk countries, such as Japan and Korea, their radiation exposure, invasiveness, and high cost suggest that they are not the optimal tools for early detection of GC in many countries. Therefore, a cost-effective, and highly accurate method for GC early detection is urgently needed in clinical settings. DNA methylation plays a key role in cancer progression and metastasis and has been demonstrated as a promising marker for cancer early detection.Aims and methods: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of DNA methylation markers associated with GC, the assays developed for GC early detection, challenges in methylation marker discovery and application, and the future prospects of utilizing methylation markers for early detection of GC. Through our analysis, we found that the currently reported DNA methylation markers related to GC are mainly in the early discovery stage. Most of them have only been evaluated in tissue samples. The majority of non-invasive assays developed based on blood lack standardized sampling protocols, pre-analytical procedures, and multicenter validation, and they exhibit insufficient sensitivity for early-stage GC detection. Meanwhile, the reported GC DNA methylation markers are generally considered pan-cancer markers.Conclusion: Therefore, future endeavors should focus on identifying additional methylation markers specific to GC and establishing non-invasive diagnostic assays that rely on these markers. These assays should undergo multicenter, large-scale prospective validation in diverse populations.",2023/7/25,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:53,,1234645,,1234645,14,,Front.

As a biomarker, collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) is often dysregulated in some cancer types. However, the expression profile of COL1A1 and functional mechanism in GC is still unclear. METHODS: To screen for the different expression genes of GC vs. adjacent tissues, an RNA-seq dataset containing 30 clinical samples and multi-omics datasets of 478 samples were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, respectively. Then the functional enrichment analysis and survival analysis of dysregulated genes were performed. Furthermore, through constructing the protein-protein interactive network, the function mode of COL1A1 was studied. Finally, a prognostic model was built by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox algorithm to assess the clinical value of COL1A1-network. RESULTS: Firstly, a total of 89 different expression genes (58 down-regulated and 31 up-regulated) that appeared simultaneously in both GEO and TCGA datasets were detected and enriched in some functions regarding the extracellular matrix. However, only 12 genes were significantly correlative with overall survival of GC patients. Among them, ASPN, COL1A1, COL12A1, FNDC1, INHBA and MMP12 could form a network that might activate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Meanwhile, a prognostic model containing ASPN and INHBA was able to divide GC patients into 2 groups with different risks and predict 5-years survival accurately (AUC = 0.732, 95% CI (0.619, 0.845)).

Early detection of GC can significantly reduce its mortality rate. Methods: A new plasma-based multiplex DNA methylation assay combining simultaneous detection of three biomarkers (KCNQ5, C9orf50 and CLIP4) and one control gene (ACTB) was developed. It was used to examine 12 paired tissue samples and a training cohort of 151 plasma samples. Its performance was subsequently confirmed in validation cohort 1 (n = 105) and validation cohort 2 (n = 139). Results: Three methylation markers showed significantly higher methylation levels in GC tissues than in paired adjacent tissues. The assay showed a sensitivity of 67.9 % with a specificity of 86.6 % for GC detection in the training cohort, and the AUC was 0.786 (95 % CI: 0.701-0.855). The methylation levels in GC patients were significantly higher than those in benign gastric tumors and in control group. Meanwhile, the assay achieved a sensitivity of 65.5 % with a specificity of 90.0 % in the validation cohort 1, and the AUC was 0.805 (95 % CI: 0.716-0.876). In the validation cohort 2, its sensitivity and specificity were 73.7 % and 84.1 %, respectively, and the AUC was 0.851 (95 % CI: 0.776-0.909). Conclusion: The plasma-based multiplex DNA methylation assay was highly specific for GC early detection. It has the potential to become an alternative approach to improve diagnosis of GC in the clinics.",Oct-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:55,,154086,,154086,238,,Pathol. Res.

Liquid biopsy analysis using cell -free nucleic acid is a preferred method for detection. Hence, we conducted a systematic review to assess the diagnostic efficacy of cell -free nucleic acid markers for GC. Methods: We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science databases for articles that conformed to our inclusion and exclusion criteria from 2012 to 2022. The following information was abstracted: first author, year of publication, country/region, age, male proportion, tumor stage for cases, specimen type, measurement method, targeted markers and diagnostic related indicators (including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, P -value). Results: Fifty-eight studies examined cell -free RNAs (cfRNAs) with a total of 62 individual circulating markers and 7 panels in serum or plasma, while 21 studies evaluated cell -free DNAs (cfDNAs) with 29 individual circulating markers and 7 panels. For individual cfRNAs, the median (range) sensitivity and specificity were 80% (21% - 98%) and 80% (54% - 99%), respectively. The median (range) sensitivity and specificity for cfRNA panels were 86% (83% - 90%) and 75% (60% - 98%), respectively. In comparison, the median (range) sensitivity and specificity reported for individual cfDNAs were 50% (18% - 96%) and 93% (57% - 100%), respectively, while cfDNA panels had a median (range) sensitivity and specificity of 85% (41% - 92%) and 73.5% (38% - 90%), respectively. The meta results indicate that cfRNA markers exhibit high sensitivity (80%) and low specificity (80%) for detecting GC, while cfDNA markers have lower sensitivity (59%) but higher specificity (92%). Conclusions: This review has demonstrated that cell -free nucleic acids have the potential to serve as useful diagnostic markers for GC.

The aim of this study was to explore and validate the tumorsuppressive role and mechanism of Radix Bupleuri in GC. Methods: The active constituents of Radix Bupleuri were screened using TCMSP database. SwissTargetPrediction database was used to predict potential target genes of the compounds. GeneCards, TTD, DisGeNET, OMIM, and PharmGKB databases were used to search for GC -related targets. STRING database and Cytoscape 3.10 software were used for protein-protein interaction network construction and screening of core targets. DAVID database was used for GO and KEGG analyses. Core targets were validated using molecular docking. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using CCK-8 and flow cytometry after GC cells were treated with isorhamnetin. The mRNA and protein expression levels of genes were detected using qRT PCR and Western blot. The metastasis potential of GC cells was evaluated in a nude mouse model. Results: A total of 371 potential targets were retrieved by searching the intersection of Radix Bupleuri and GC targets. Petunidin, 3',4',5',3,5,6,7-Heptamethoxyflavone, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin were identified as the main bioactive compounds in Radix Bupleuri. SRC, HSP90AA1, AKT1, and EGFR, were core targets through which Radix Bupleuri suppressed GC. The tumorsuppressive effect of Radix Bupleuri on GC was mediated by multiple pathways, including PI3K-AKT, cAMP, and TNF signaling. The key compounds of Radix Bupleuri had good binding affinity with the core target. Isorhamnetin, a key component of Radix Bupleuri, could inhibit proliferation and metastasis, and induces apoptosis of GC cells. In addition, isorhamnetin could also reduce the mRNA expression of core targets, and the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway.

To improve the 5-year survival rate and reduce the number of cancer-related deaths in patients with GC, noninvasive methods for early detection need to be developed. This study aimed to evaluate the value of circulating methylated Septin 9 (SEPT9) and ring finger protein 180 (RNF180) for the early diagnosis of GC. Methods: Seventy-four patients with early GC, 99 patients with benign gastric diseases (BGD) (inflammation, polyps, intestinal metaplasia, ulcers, and erosion), and 57 cases with no evidence of disease (NED) were enrolled. Methylated SEPT9 and RNF180 in circulating cell-free DNA in blood samples from each group were detected, and the positivity rates were calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), confidence interval (CI), and area under the curve (AUC) were determined for methylated SEPT9 and RNF180 in relation to early GC. Results: As a diagnostic target, methylated SEPT9 had a sensitivity of 28.3% (95% CI: 18.5-40.0%), specificity of 94.2% (95% CI: 89.3-97.3%), and AUC value of 0.616 (95% CI: 52.0-71.1%).

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a spectroscopic technique based on the surface plasmon resonance of precious metal nanoparticles, which can effectively detect low-abundance tumor markers. Combining SERS technology with sensors has high potential in the diagnosis and screening of GC. Methods: A novel Au/Si nano-umbrella array (Au/SiNUA) was prepared as a SERS substrate and the substrate was functionalized using the corresponding tumor marker aptamers for the detection of clinical biological samples using a one-step recognition release mechanism. Optimization of aptamer and complementary chain concentrations and detection time for optimal sensor preparation. Results: Au/SiNUA were tested to have good SERS enhancement activity. The proposed aptamer biosensor has good specificity and stability, with a low detection time of 18 min and a limit of detection (LOD) at the fM level, which is superior to most of the methods reported so far; and the accuracy of the clinical assay is comparable to that of the ELISA method.

However, some tumors do not display a clear molecular and genetic signature. While there are some cellular processes regulated by second messenger intracellular pathways indeed involved in carcinogenesis. The first intracellular second messenger was described as cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) play a crucial role in several biological processes; The dysregulation of PKA-mediated signaling in several types of cancer should be investigated. More interesting, the alpha catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAC alpha) could be secreted into the conditioned medium by different types of cancer cells, and it also existed in the serum of some cancer patients, defined as extracellular protein kinase A (ECPKA). Methods: The levels of serum PKAC alpha from healthy people, gastric cancer and colon cancer patients were detected by ELISA kits. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of PKAC alpha in cancer tissue and the adjacent mucosa. Mann-Whitney test was applied to analyze the patients' characteristics and serum PKAC alpha. ROC analyses were performed to further evaluate the utility of PKAC alpha in cancer diagnosis. The correlation of serum PKAC alpha and T stage, age, and tumor markers were analyzed by Spearman rank and Pearson correlation analysis, respectively. Results: There were significant differences of PKAC alpha in serum between the volunteers and the gastric cancers (P<0.01), but not the colorectal cancers (P>0.05). ROC analyses evaluated the utility of PKAC alpha for gastric cancer with 61.90% sensitivities and 87.50% specificities. The serum PKAC alpha was correlated with tumor marker CA50, while there was no significant difference of PKAC alpha expression between the gastric/colorectal cancer tissue and the adjacent mucosa. Conclusions: The above results implied that PKAC alpha levels might be a potential biomarker for the early screening of gastric cancers.

Recent studies suggest that cell-mediated immunity influences the outcome of infection, including the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The T-cell response can be characterized in terms of the secreted cytokine profile, which in turn influences the B-cell response including the balance of IgG subclass antibody. Methods: Serum anti-H. pylori IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies were studied by ELISA in subjects with benign gastric diseases, gastric dysplasia and gastric adenocarcinoma. Results: The distribution patterns of IgG subclass anti-H. pylori antibody varies significantly between H. pylori-linked benign and malignant disease in subjects infected with H. pylori. Significantly lower IgG2 levels were found in subjects with gastric adenocarcinoma compared with those with reflux esophagitis, chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, and peptic ulcer, while IgG1 antibody remained at similar levels in both benign and malignant disease. A limited study of seropositive subjects with premalignant change was consistent with the fall in IgG2 antibody pre-dating malignant change, although pre-eradication results are needed to validate these data. Conclusions: These studies indicate that subjects with low levels of IgG2 anti-H. pylori antibody are at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, and that the previously described linkage between gastric adenocarcinoma and low total IgG antibody does not simply reflect reduced gastric colonization. The diagnostic value of this assay for pre-endoscopy screening is attractive. (C) 2005 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Sep-05,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:20,,1338-1343,,9,20,,J. Gastroenterol.

We evaluated the association between the interval between upper gastrointestinal endoscopies and the gastric cancer stage at diagnosis in patients from a region of high prevalence. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 2485 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma. We evaluated the effect on cancer stage of the interval between the endoscopy that was diagnostic for gastric cancer and the endoscopy preceding it. Patients were stratified into 7 groups: 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, >5-year intervals and those who were never screened. RESULTS: The risk of higher cancer stage at diagnosis increased by 23% per increase in interval length (odds ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-1.28). Compared to the never-screened, the odds ratio of having a higher stage of cancer decreased gradually from 0.53 (95% CI = 0.41-0.69) in the >5-year interval group to 0.31 (95% CI = 0.24-0.40) in the 1-year interval group. Compared to the 1-year interval group, the risk of advanced gastric cancer was increased in the 4- and 5-year, but not the 2- and 3-year, interval groups. However, patients with a family history of gastric cancer were more likely to have a higher stage at diagnosis if they had a 3-year interval rather than a 1-year interval. CONCLUSIONS: A significant benefit in cancer stage at diagnosis was observed in all interval groups compared to never-screened.

However, there is limited evidence on the cost efficiency of delivering this intervention, especially on a national level in spite of cost efficiency being a major determinant of the actual cost-effectiveness of a cancer prevention programme. The Singapore Gastric Cancer Epidemiology Clinical and Genetic Programme (GCEP) is a demonstration project offering scheduled endoscopy to the Chinese population aged 50 years or older in Singapore. By assessing the cost efficiency of the GCEP, this study aimed to provide empirical evidence on the cost structure and mechanisms underlying cost generation in conducting GC surveillance, thus informing resource allocation and programme budgeting for the Singapore government. Methods: From a societal perspective, we reported on the direct cost (resource consumption) of conducting endoscopic surveillance through the GCEP network. We retrospectively collected individual-level data of 216 subjects recruited at the National University Hospital, Singapore from 01/04/2004 to 31/10/2010. The Overall Cost, Clinical Cost, GCEP Cost and Personal Cost incurred in serving one subject was computed and discounted as 2004 US dollar (US$) per capita for every year. The Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) was used to model the data. Results: All cost indices continuously declined over the 6.5-year costing period. For the total sample, Overall Cost, Clinical Cost, GCEP Cost and Personal Cost declined by 42.3%, 54.1%, 30% and 25.7% respectively. This downward trend existed for age and gender subgroups and the high risk group only with cost reductions varying between 3.5% and 58.4%. The GEE models confirmed statistical significance of the downward trend and of its association with risk profile, where the moderate risk group had cost indices at most 77% of the high risk group. Conclusions: Our study offered empirical evidence of improved cost efficiency of a surveillance programme for GC in the early phase of programme implementation. Mechanisms such as economies of scale and self-learning were found to be involved in the cost reduction. Our findings highlighted the importance of assessing the cost efficiency and offered valuable insights for future programme budgeting and policy making.",2013/4/15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:17,,139,,1,13,,BMC Health Serv.

METHODS: Twelve of 615 (2%) patients (10 males, median 72 years), treated by ESD at our center, were diagnosed as type ""0-IIb"" gastric cancer. Ten had exclusively type ""0-IIb"", while two had combined types ""0-IIb+IIc"" and ""0-IIa+IIb"" gastric cancer. Initial diagnosis was made during screening gastroscopy, while NBI magnification endoscopy combined with indigo-carmine chromoendoscopy were also used. RESULTS: White light endoscopy showed only superficial redness. One patient with signet-ring carcinoma showed whitish appearance. Indigo-carmine chromoendoscopy showed better visualization, while NBI magnification endoscopy revealed abnormal mucosal microsurface and microvascular findings which enabled border marking. ESD with curative intention was completed without complications. Histological examination showed complete (R0) resection, in 10 patients (83%). One patient with positive margins received additional surgery (8%). Mean procedure time was 149 (range 60-190) min. One to six years post-ESD all patients remain alive. CONCLUSIONS: ESD is considered a safe and effective curative treatment for type ""0-IIb"" gastric cancer, resulting in long-term disease-free survival. NBI magnification endoscopy is effective for accurate optical identification and border marking of type ""0-IIb"" early gastric cancer.",2015,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:57,,,,1,28,,Ann Gastroenterol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 72-80 Place: Greece Web of Science ID: 25609014,,,,"early gastric cancer; 1353; Keywords Endoscopic submucosal dissection; narrow band imaging magnification endoscopy; type ""0-IIb""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: The objective of this article is to determine the cost-utility of screening strategies for gastric cancer in a European country. Methods: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model comparing three screening strategies versus no screening: stand-alone upper endoscopy, endoscopy combined with a colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy after a positive faecal occult blood test or pepsinogens serologic screening. Clinical data were collected from systematic reviews, costs from published national data and utilities as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The threshold was set at (sic)37,000 (2016 prices). Results: Upper endoscopy combined with screening colonoscopy (every 10 or 5 years) had an ICER of 15,407/QALY and (sic)30,908/QALY respectively, stand-alone endoscopic screening (every five years) an ICER of (sic)70,693/QALY and pepsinogens screening an ICER of (sic)143,344/QALY. Sensitivity analyses revealed that only endoscopic costs <(sic)75, a provision of only three endoscopies per patient or a gastric cancer risk >25/100,000 would make stand-alone endoscopic screening cost-effective. Conclusion: Endoscopic gastric cancer screening in Europe can be cost-effective if combined with a screening colonoscopy in countries with a gastric cancer risk 10 per 100,000.",Mar-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,192-202,,2,6,,United European Gastroenterol.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of training on inter-observer agreement in diagnosis and grading of endoscopic atrophic gastritis (EAG) according to the level of endoscopists' experience. Methods: Twelve endoscopists (six less-experienced and six experienced) participated in this prospective study. The training session consisted of 1) four interventions with two-week intervals, and 2) a follow-up period (two follow-up assessments without feedback). EAG was categorized as C1 to O3 according to the Kimura-Takemoto classification. Kappa statistics were used to calculate inter-observer agreement. Results: At baseline, kappa indexes were 0.18 in the less-experienced group and 0.32 in the experienced group, respectively. After four interventions with feedback, the kappa index improved in both groups and was sustained during the follow-up period. Overall diagnostic yields of EAG were 43.1% +/- 10.7% in pre-intervention and 46.8% +/- 5.9% in post-intervention. Variability in the rate of diagnosis of EAG significantly decreased in the less-experienced group (r = 0.04, P = 0.003).

However, it is not clear how endoscopic screening for early gastric cancer affects incidence or mortality. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between endoscopic screening for the mortality and incidence of early gastric cancer. Materials and methods: This protocol established in this study has been reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for cohort and case-control studies in cases without early gastric cancer until March 31, 2020. We will use a combination of Medical Subject Heading and free-text terms with various synonyms to search based on the Eligibility criteria. Two investigators independently reviewed the included studies and extracted relevant data. The relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were used as effect estimate. I-square test, substantial heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias assessment will be performed accordingly. Stata 15.0 and Review Manger 5.3 are used for meta-analysis and systematic review. Results: The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Conclusion: The results of this review will be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. This evidence may also provide helpful evidence of whether endoscopic screening would reduce the mortality and incidence of early gastric cancer.

We sought to identify serum PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that could serve as sensitive and specific noninvasive biomarkers for early colorectal cancer detection. Methods: We screened the piRNA expression profile in sera from 7 patients with colorectal cancer and 7 normal controls using small RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed piRNAs were measured in a training cohort of 140 patients with colorectal cancer and 140 normal controls using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. The identified piRNAs were evaluated in two independent validation cohorts of 180 patients with colorectal cancer and 180 normal controls. Finally, the diagnostic value of the identified piRNAs for colorectal adenoma (CRA) was assessed, and their expression was measured in 50 patients with lung cancer, 50 with breast cancer, and 50 with gastric cancer. Results: The piRNAs piR-020619 and piR-020450 were consistently elevated in sera of patients with colorectal cancer as compared with controls. A predicative panel based on the two piRNAs was established that displayed high diagnostic accuracy for colorectal cancer detection. The two-piRNA panel could detect small-size and early-stage colorectal cancer with an area under the ROC curve of 0.863 and 0.839, respectively. Combined use of the two piRNAs could effectively distinguish CRA from controls. Aberrant elevation of the two piRNAs was not observed in sera of patients with lung, breast, and gastric cancer. Conclusions: Serum piR-020619 and piR-020450 show a strong potential as colorectal cancer-specific early detection biomarkers.

We aimed to identify serum protein biomarker for the detection of early-stage upper gastrointestinal cancer. Methods: We performed a three-tiered study including 2028 participants from three medical centres. First, we applied two different antibody arrays to screen candidate serum proteins that increased in 20 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) compared with 20 normal controls. We then evaluated the selected protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 1064 participants including 731 upper gastrointestinal cancer patients (287 ESCCs, 237 oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas (EJAs), and 207 stomach cancers) and 333 normal controls. The diagnostic value of the selected protein was finally validated in two independent cohorts of ESCC patients and controls (n=472 and 452, respectively). The receiver operating characteristic was used to calculate diagnostic accuracy. Findings: Serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) identified in both antibody arrays showed significantly elevated levels in upper gastrointestinal cancers, compared with normal controls. Serum IGFBP-1 provided high diagnostic accuracy of early-stage ESCC, EJA, stomach and cancer (areas under the curve: 0.898, 0.936 and 0.864, respectively). This protein maintained diagnostic performance for earlystage ESCC in independent cohorts 1 and 2 (0.849 and 0.911, respectively). Additionally, serum levels of IGFBP-1 dropped significantly after surgical resection of primary tumours, compared with the corresponding pre-operative ESCC samples (p < 0.05). Interpretation: Serum IGFBP-1 represents a promising diagnostic biomarker to detect early-stage upper gastrointestinal cancer. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

In this study, data for the methylation status of 4 methylation genes (CDO1, HOPX, Reprimo, and E-cadherin) to predict the onset of RGC are presented.; RESULTS: The 4 genes showed hypermethylation in RGC tumors in contrast to the corresponding non-cancerous mucosa tissues. The methylation level in the non-cancerous mucosa tissues of the initial surgery was obviously high in initial malignant disease for CDO1 (P = 0.0001), while in initial benign one for E-cadherin (P = 0.003). Promoter DNA methylation status in the remnant non-cancerous mucosa tissues together with the basic clinical data in turn predicted either initial malignant disease or initial benign disease with a high AUC score of 0.94, suggesting that methylation events are differentially recognized between the initial malignant and benign disease. We then finally confirmed that 4 genes hypermethylation of the non-cancerous tissues by biopsy prior to onset of RGC could predict terms until RGC occurred (P < 0.0001).; METHODS: A total of 58 RGC patients were used to establish the model. The 4 genes promoter methylation were analyzed for DNA obtained from the patient's specimens using quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain reaction.; CONCLUSIONS: This risk model would help provide guidance for endoscopic surveillance plan of RGC after gastrectomy.",2019,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 20:20,,,,25,10,,Oncotarget,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 2423-2434 Place: United States Web of Science ID: MEDLINE:31069006,,,,1286; 1287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular markers such as miRNA (microRNA) can have great importance in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer. Expression of miR-21 and miR-221 are deregulated in many types of human cancers. This study aimed to investigate the differences in miRNA expression patterns within the Iranian population. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from gastric cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 32 patients. Expression levels of miR-21 and miR-221 were detected by Real time RT-PCR using a specific primer, with 5s rRNA as the internal reference gene. RESULTS: Our data showed that the expression levels of miR-21 and miR-221 in gastric cancer samples were significantly higher than in paired non-cancerous samples (P value less than 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses yielded the area under the curve (AUC) values of 80.30 for miR-21 and 93.30 for miR-221, and combined ROC analysis revealed the highest AUC value of 96.90 in discriminating GC patients from healthy controls. CONCLUSION: It seems that miR-21 and miR-221 expression pattern in Iranian patients with gastric cancer are similar to any other population.

This study aimed to evaluate the level of m(6)A as a biomarker for gastric cancer (GC) diagnosis. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 100 GC patients, 30 benign gastric disease (BGD) patients, and 75 healthy controls (HCs). Levels of m(6)A in total RNA and expression of m(6)A-related proteins were analyzed. RESULTS: The m(6)A levels in peripheral blood RNA were significantly increased in the GC group compared with those in the BGD or HC groups; moreover, levels increased with the progression and metastasis of GC and decreased in GC patients after surgery. The area under the curve (AUC) for m(6)A in the GC group was 0.929 (95% CI, 0.88-0.96), which is markedly greater than the AUCs for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 0.694) and carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199; 0.603). The combination of CEA and CA199 with m(6)A improved the AUC to 0.955 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98). The expressions of m(6)A demethylases ALKBH5 and FTO were significantly downregulated in the GC group compared with the HC group. Coculture with GC cells increased the m(6)A of RNA in promyelocytic (HL-60) and monocytic (THP-1) leukemia cells and nontumorigenic human peripheral blood B lymphocyte cells (PENG-EBV). Furthermore, a xenograft model enhanced the m(6)A in peripheral blood RNA of mice. Accordingly, expressions of ALKBH5 and FTO were decreased both in vitro and in vivo.

However, whether the commonly used cancer methylation markers cause ""false positives"" in the plasma of pregnant women has not been comprehensively evaluated. Methods: We conducted a case-control study from February 2021 to March 2023, which included 138 pregnant women and 44 control women. Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was isolated and bisulfite-converted, and then the methylation levels of eight methylated markers related to gastrointestinal cancer (SEPT9, SDC2, C9orf50, KCNQ5, CLIP4, TFPI2, ELMO1 and ZNF582) and three markers related to lung cancer (SHOX2, RASSF1A and PTGER4) were analyzed. Results: When comparing the plasma of pregnant women to that of control women, SEPT9, CLIP4, ZNF582, SHOX2, RASSF1A and PTGER showed significantly higher levels of methylation (p < 0.05).

Identification of the risk factors for development of DM and the prognostic factors for patients with DM is essential in development of individualized treatment of patients at the advanced stage with specific metastasis. Material/Methods: Records of patients with gastric cancer were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Survival duration of patients with specific DM was estimated, and the prognostic factors were investigated using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. The logistic regression model was used to reveal the inherent risk factors for development of DM. Results: Eventually, 32.6% (11,918 out of 36,588) of gastric cancer patients were diagnosed with DM between 2010 and 2015, among whom 5,361, 1,778, 1,495, and 231 patients were diagnosed with liver, lung, bone, and brain metastasis, respectively. The median overall survival for patients with DM was 5.0 (95% CI: 4.8-5.2) months, with a 5-year survival rate of 3.9%. Primary tumor site, histology types, tumor grade, T stage, N stage, surgery, chemotherapy, and the number of metastases were associated with worse survival. Younger age and higher tumor grade were positively associated with the development of DM. Conclusions: Initial DM was found in 32.6% of patients with gastric cancer.

RESULTS: Our analysis revealed the increased expression levels of miR-21 (p = 0.034), miR-25 (p = 0.0003), miR-93 (p = 0.0406), and miR-106b (p = 0.023) in GC samples. In addition, GC patients with positive lymph node metastasis showed the up-regulation of miR-25, miR-93, and miR-106b (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that the expression of miR-21, miR-25, miR-93, and miR-106b altered in GC, and some of them may be further investigated as biomarkers for GC early detection and prognosis prediction.",2018,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:56,,,,6,22,,Iran Biomed J,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 367-73 Place: Iran Web of Science ID: 29859516,,,,Biomarkers; Stomach cancer; microRNAs; 1295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the HER2 protein is the most common screening test, thus precise and reproducible IHC-scoring is of utmost importance. Interobserver variance still is a problem; in particular in gastric carcinomas the reliable differentiation of IHC scores 2+ and 1+ is challenging. Herein we describe the physical basis of what we called the 'magnification rule': Different microscope objectives are employed to reproducibly subdivide the continuous spectrum of IHC staining intensities into distinct categories (1+, 2+, 3+). Methods: HER2-IHC was performed on 120 breast cancer biopsy specimens (n = 40 per category). Width and color-intensity of membranous DAB chromogen precipitates were measured by whole-slide scanning and digital morphometry. Image-analysis data were related to semi-quantitative manual scoring according to the magnification rule and to the optical properties of the employed microscope objectives. Results: The semi-quantitative manual HER2-IHC scores are correlated to color-intensity measured by image-analysis and to the width of DAB-precipitates. The mean widths +/- standard deviations of precipitates were: IHC-score 1+, 0.64 +/- 0.1 mu m; score 2+, 1.0 +/- 0.23 mu m; score 3+, 2.14 +/- 0.4 mu m. The width of precipitates per category matched the optical resolution of the employed microscope objective lenses: Approximately 0.4 mu m (40x), 1.0 mu m (10x) and 2.0 mu m (5x). Conclusions: Perceived intensity, width of the DAB chromogen precipitate, and absolute color-intensity determined by image-analysis are linked. These interrelations form the physical basis of the 'magnification rule': 2+ precipitates are too narrow to be observed with 5x microscope objectives, 1+ precipitates are too narrow for 10x objectives. Thus, the rule uses the optical resolution windows of standard diagnostic microscope objectives to derive the width of the DAB-precipitates. The width is in turn correlated with color-intensity. Hereby, the more or less subjective estimation of IHC scores based only on the staining-intensity is replaced by a quasi-morphometric measurement. The principle seems universally applicable to immunohistochemical stainings of membrane-bound biomarkers that require an intensity-dependent scoring.",2018/3/12,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,19,,1,13,,Diagn.

We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of miRNA as a diagnostic marker for gastric cancer in the circulation. Methods: Plasma samples from 3 independent groups comprise 123 gastric cancer patients and 111 healthy controls for miRNA profiling from microarray screening. Results: Microarray data showed that 25 miRNAs were upregulated in gastric cancer patients and 6 highly expressed miRNAs (miR-18a, miR-140-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-627, miR-629 and miR-652) were selected for validation. In an independent validation set, levels of miR-627, miR-629 and miR-652 were significantly higher in gastric cancer patients than healthy controls (P < 0.0001). An algorithm with improved sensitivity and specificity as gastric cancer classifier was adopted and validated in another random set of 15 plasma samples. Results showed that combination of 3 miRNAs obtained the highest area under curve, with a cut-off at 0.373, with a sensitivity of 86.7 % and a specificity of 85.5 %.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported to regulate gene expression through modulating a wide range of pathophysiologic processes. Serum miRNAs are promising biomarkers in various human cancers, including GC. In the present study, we aimed to indentify microRNA-145 (miR-145) as a serum biomarker for GC screening in clinical. Methods: Serum miR-145 expression of 114 GC patients, 68 patients with precancerous lesion (PL) and 95 healthy donors was detected through qRT-PCR. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum miR-145 characterized as the alternative biomarker. Serum miR-145 levels were correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics and follow-up information of the GC patients. Multivariate regression analysis was finally conducted to confirm if serum miR-145 expression could be regarded as an independent risk factor for GC patients' prognosis. Results: Serum miR-145 levels were dramatically lower in the GC patients than in healthy controls and PL patients (all P<0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that serum miR-145 was a specific diagnostic biomarker for distinguishing GC patients from healthy individuals and PL patients. Low expression of serum miR-145 was significantly correlated to tumor size (P=0.018), distant metastasis (P=0.039), histologic differentiation (P=0.016) and TNM stage (P=0.012). GC patients with relatively lower serum miR-145 levels had remarkably decreased disease-free survival (DFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate after surgery (all P<0.01). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that serum miR-145 level (P=0.035) was an independent risk factor for OS in GC. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that serum miR-145 level could be considered as a promising biomarker for GC diagnosis in the future.",2017,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:56,,,,6,10,,Int. J. Clin.

To improve clinical outcomes, effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment employing new diagnostic biomarkers are required to achieve early detection and predict recurrence and prognosis. Materials and Methods: Transcriptome analysis was conducted using surgically resected gastric tissues from four patients with metastatic GC. A total of 228 pairs of primary GC tissues and corresponding normal adjacent tissues were subjected to mRNA expression analysis. To validate our findings, we accessed an integrated microarray dataset and RNA sequencing data of GC cell lines. Results: We idented stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (STRA6) as a differentially overexpressed gene, which encodes a transmembrane protein that mediates the cellular uptake of retinol. To investigate how STRA6 contributes to the malignant phenotype of GC cells, we mined public datasets and found the mRNA encoding retinol binding protein 1 (RBP1), which is associated with retinoid metabolism, was co-expressed with STRA6. Furthermore, STRA6 mRNA levels were significantly higher in GC tissues compared to the corresponding noncancerous adjacent tissues of 228 surgically resected gastric tissue samples. Moreover, patients with high levels of STRA6 mRNA experienced significantly shorter disease-free survival and overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that high levels of STRA6 served as a significant risk factor. Conclusion: Patients with high levels of STRA6 mRNA experienced signantly worse clinical outcomes, indicating that STRA6 may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of GC.",2020,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:56,,,,5,17,,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 509-516 Place: EDITORIAL OFFICE 1ST KM KAPANDRITIOU-KALAMOU RD KAPANDRITI, PO BOX 22, ATHENS 19014, GREECE Publisher: Int Inst Anticancer Research Web of Science ID: WOS:000563922400005",,,,Gastric cancer; biomarker; prognosis; recurrence; 1291; STRA6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of serological parameters including serum pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII) and pepsinogen I: II ratio for the screening atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. METHODS: The study population consisted of 132 dyspeptic patients who had undergone upper endoscopy with biopsy. Blood samples for ELISA assays of serum PGI, PGII and IgG antibodies against Helicobacter pylori were drawn. Comparison between the two groups was done by Student's t- test, and Mann Whitney test. Cut-off points were calculated using receiver operating curves (ROC). RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the study population was 51.4 (+/-15.5) years. Values of PGI and PG ratio decreased significantly in the atrophic gastritis as compared with the control group (p<0.05). Values of PG and PG ratio didn't show any significant difference between the gastric cancer and control group (p>0.05). For patients with atrophic gastritis, the area under the ROC for PGI was 0.639 (95% CI:0.538-0.741, p=0.008) in which the best cut-off value was 40mug/L (sensitivity 90%, specificity 67%, accuracy 69%, negative predictive value 92%, YI : 0.429). The area under the ROC for PG ratio was 0.711 (95% CI: 0.617-0.806, p=0.0001) and the best cut-off value was 8 (sensitivity 71%, specificity 71%, accuracy 71%, negative predictive value 86%,YI : 0.431). CONCLUSION: It seems that PGI, PGI: PGII ratio is potential biomarkers for screening atrophic gastritis with high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and negative predictive value.

Furthermore, we conducted an independent validation set of 50 gastric cancer patients and 50 healthy controls comparing miR-223 expression. We also analyzed miR-223 expression in vitro. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria and therefore included in this meta-analysis. We found that miR-223 yielded a pooled area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89 (sensitivity: 81%, specificity: 84%) in discriminating cancer from controls. In our validation test, plasma miR-223 levels in GC patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls (P<0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that AUC was 0.812 with a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 80%. Moreover, the expression trend of miR-223 in plasma samples was in accordance with that of tissue and cell samples.

We systematically reviewed cost-effectiveness studies that address screening for gastric cancer and/or surveillance of precancerous conditions and lesions. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies was performed by conducting a sensitive search in seven databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Current Contents Connect, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Academic Search Complete, and CINAHL Plus), independently evaluated by two investigators. Articles were evaluated for type of study, perspective, model, intervention, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, clinical or cost variables, and quality, according to published guidelines. Results: From 2395 abstracts, 23 articles were included: 19 concerning population screening and 4 on following up premalignant lesions. Studies on Helicobacter pylori screening concluded that serology was cost-effective, depending on cancer incidence and endoscopy cost (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: 6264-25,881), and eradication after endoscopic resection was also cost-effective (dominant) based on one study. Studies on imaging screening concluded that endoscopy was more cost-effective than no screening (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: 3376-26,836). Articles on follow-up of premalignant lesions reported conflicting results (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: 1868-72,519 for intestinal metaplasia; 18,600-39,800 for dysplasia). Quality assessment revealed a unanimous lack of a detailed systematic review and fulfillment of a median number of 23 items (20-26) of 35 possible ones.

This study validated whether CGI is more prevalent in H. pylori-infected nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD) subjects than in duodenal ulcer (DU) controls and whether it is reversible after H. pylori eradication or is correlated with noninvasive biomarkers. Materials and Methods: In this longitudinal cohort study, 573 H. pylori-infected subjects were enrolled, including 349 NUD and 224 DU. Gastric specimens were provided to assess CGI, spasmolyic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), and Operative Link on Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia assessment (OLGIM). Serum pepsinogen I and II levels were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CGI subjected were followed up at least 1 year after H. pylori eradication. Results: NUD subjects had higher prevalence rates of CGI (47.0% vs 29.9%, P < .001) and OLGIM stages III-IV (24.1% vs 15.2%, P = .01) than controls. CGI was highly prevalent in NUD subjects after the age of 40, which was 10 years earlier than atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. NUD subjects with CGI had higher risk of SPEM (OR 2.86, P < .001) and lower serum pepsinogen I/II ratios (P < .001) than those without CGI. Serum pepsinogen I/II ratios < 9 could predict CGI modestly (AUROC 0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.74). CGI was regressed after eradication (P < .001).

However, they are associated with high false positives and high false negatives. Alternative noninvasive approaches, such as cancer-related features in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments, have been gradually identified and play essential roles in early cancer detection. The integrated analysis of multiple cfDNA features has enhanced detection sensitivity compared to individual features.Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate an assay based on assessing genomic-scale methylation and fragmentation profiles of plasma cfDNA for early cancer detection, thereby facilitating the early diagnosis of GC. The primary objective is to evaluate the overall specificity and sensitivity of the assay in predicting GC within the entire cohort, and subsequently within each clinical stage of GC. The secondary objective involved investigating the specificity and sensitivity of the assay in combination with possible serological indicators.Methods: This is an observational case-control study. Blood samples will be prospectively collected before gastroscopy from 180 patients with GC and 180 nonmalignant control subjects (healthy or with benign gastric diseases). Cases and controls will be randomly divided into a training and a testing data set at a ratio of 2:1. Plasma cfDNA will be isolated and extracted, followed by bisulfite-free low-depth whole methylome sequencing. A multidimensional model named Thorough Epigenetic Marker Integration Solution (THEMIS) will be constructed in the training data set. The model includes features such as the methylated fragment ratio, chromosomal aneuploidy of featured fragments, fragment size index, and fragment end motif. The performance of the model in distinguishing between patients with cancer and noncancer controls will then be evaluated in the testing data set. Furthermore, GC-related biomarkers, such as pepsinogen, gastrin-17, and Helicobacter pylori, will be measured for each patient, and their predictive accuracy will be assessed both independently and in combination with the THEMIS modelResults: Recruitment began in November 2022 and will be ended in April 2024. As of August 2022,250 patients have been enrolled. The final data analysis is anticipated to be completed by September 2024.Conclusions: This is the first registered case-control study designed to investigate a stacked ensemble model integrating several cfDNA features generated from a bisulfite-free whole methylome sequencing assay. These features include methylation patterns, fragmentation profiles, and chromosomal copy number changes, with the aim of identifying the GC population. This study will determine whether multidimensional analysis of cfDNA will prove to be an effective strategy for distinguishing patients with GC from nonmalignant individuals within the Chinese population. We anticipate the THEMIS model will complement the standard-of-care screening and aid in identifying high-risk patients for further diagnosis.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrial.gov NCT05668910; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05668910 International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/48247",2023,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,e48247,,e48247,12,,JMIR RES.

To identify the determinants of response, we developed a TMEscore model to assess tumor microenvironment (TME), which was previously proven to be a biomarker for ICBs. Methods: A reference database of TMEscore assays was established using PCR assay kits containing 30 TME genes. This multi-center prospective clinical trial (NCT#04850716) included patients with mGC who were administered ICB combined with chemotherapy as a first-line regimen. Eighty-six tumor samples extracted from five medical centers before treatment were used to estimate the TMEscore, PD-L1 (CPS), and mismatch repair deficiency. Findings: The objective response rate (ORR) and median PFS of the cohort were 31.4% and six months. Enhanced ORR was observed in TMEscore-high mGC patients (ORR = 59%). The survival analysis demonstrated that high TMEscore was significantly associated with a more favorable PFS and OS. Moreover, TMEscore was found to be a predictive biomarker that surpassed MSI and CPS (AUC = 0.873, 0.511, and 0.524, respectively). By integrating the TMEscore and clinical variables, the fused model further enhances the predictive efficiency and translational application in a clinical setting. Conclusions: This prospective clinical study indicates that the TMEscore assay is a robust biomarker for screening patients with mGC who may derive survival benefits from ICB plus chemotherapy.",2024/11/8,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:50,,,,11,5,,Med,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 19 Place: Cambridge Publisher: Cell Press Web of Science ID: WOS:001355618000001,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Using qRT-PCR-based Exiqon panel, we identified 58 differentially expressed miRNAs from three gastric cancer pool samples and one normal control (NC) pool in the initial screening phase. Identified miRNAs were further validated in the training (49 gastric cancer vs. 47 NCs) and validation phases (154 gastric cancer vs. 120 NCs) using qRT-PCR. The expression levels of the miRNAs were also determined in tissues, arterial serum, and exosomes. Results: Consequently, six serum miRNAs (miR10b-5p, miR132-3p, miR185-5p, miR195-5p, miR-20a3p, and miR296-5p) were significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer compared with NCs. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the six-miRNA panel were 0.764 and 0.702 for the training and validation phases, respectively. miR10b-5p and miR296-5p were significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues (n = 188). In addition, patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy with high expression of miR10b-5p or miR296-5p in tissues tended to suffer worse overall survival. Furthermore, the expression levels of miR10b-5p, miR195-5p, miR20a-3p, and miR296-5p were significantly elevated in exosomes from gastric cancer serum samples (n = 30). Conclusions: We identified a six-miRNA panel in serum for the detection of gastric cancer. Impact: Our findings provide a novel serum miRNA signature for gastric cancer diagnosis, and will serve as the basis of the application of circulating miRNAs in clinical for the detection of gastric cancer in the future.

However, the mixture of GC subtypes may have led to the inconsistent circulating miRNA profiles, and the clinical performance of circulating miRNAs has not yet been evaluated independently on early detection of GC. Methods: A four-phase study was designed with a total of 160 cancer-free controls, 124 patients with gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) and 36 patients diagnosed gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA). In the discovery phase, we screened the miRNA expression profile in plasma of 40 GNCA patients (stage I) and 40 matched controls by TaqMan low density array (TLDA) chips with pooled samples. Differentially expressed miRNAs were further validated in individual sample using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) in the training phase. Subsequently, in an independent validation phase, the identified miRNAs were evaluated in 48 GNCA patients (stage I) and 102 matched controls. Finally, the identified miRNAs were further assessed in an external validation phase including advanced GNCA and GCA patients. Additionally, the expression levels of identified miRNAs were measured in the media of BGC823 and MGC803 cell lines. Results: Five miRNAs (miR-16, miR-25, miR-92a, miR-451 and miR-486-5p) showed consistently elevated levels in plasma of the GC patients as compared with controls, and were identified to be potential markers for GNCA with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.850 to 0.925 and 0.694 to 0.790 in the training and validation phases, respectively. The five-miRNA panel presented a high diagnostic accuracy for the early-stage GNCA (AUCs 0.989 and 0.812 for the training and validation phases, respectively). Three miRNAs (miR-16, miR-25 and miR-92a) were excreted into the culture media of GC cell lines.

Little is known about their value in the diagnosis of cancers. Methods: The targeted circRNA of this study was selected using two circRNA databases: CircBase (http://circbase.org/) and circ2Traits (http://gyanxet-beta.com/circdb/). Divergent primers, rather than commonly used convergent primers, for the circRNA were designed. The circRNA levels in 101 paired gastric cancer tissues and adjacent nontumorous tissues from surgical gastric cancer patients and 36 paired plasma samples from preoperative and postoperative gastric cancer patients were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (gRT-PCR). The specificity of the amplified products was measured by melting curve analysis and DNA sequencing. To observe the stability of circRNA, three randomly selected samples of gastric cancer tissues were stored at room temperature, 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C, and then, their circRNA levels were analyzed. To verify the reproducibility of gRT-PCR, circRNA levels were detected in a set of specimens (n = 15) in two independent experiments with an interval of one day. Then, the correlation of their Ct values was determined. The relationships between circRNA expression levels and clinicopathological factors of patients with gastric cancer were further analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to evaluate the diagnostic value. Results: Hsa_circ_002059, a typical circular RNA, was first found to be significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with paired adjacent nontumorous tissues (p < 0.001). Its levels in plasma collected from postoperative gastric cancer patients were found significantly different from those from preoperative gastric cancer patients. The area under the ROC curve was 0.73. Importantly, we further found that lower expression levels were significantly correlated with distal metastasis (P = 0.036), TNM stage (P = 0.042), gender (P = 0.002) and age (P = 0.022). The stability of circRNAs and the reproducibility of the qRT-PCR method for detecting circRNA levels were determined. Conclusion: These results suggested that circRNAs are highly stable in mammalian cells and that one specific circRNA, hsa_circ_002059, may be a potential novel and stable biomarker for the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma.

This study aimed to describe the potential usability of pepsinogen (PG) values in determining gastric mucosal conditions, including superficial gastritis and atrophic gastritis. Materials and Methods: We recruited 646 adult dyspeptic patients and then analyzed PG values (including PGI, PGII, and PGI/II ratio) with endoscopic findings, gastric mucosal damages, and Helicobacter pylori infection. The gastric mucosal damage and H. pylori infection were evaluated using histological examination based on the updated Sydney system. Results: Among 646 enrolled patients, 308 (47.2%), 212 (32.8%), 91 (14.1%), 34 (5.2%), and 1 (0.2%) patient were diagnosed with normal mucosa, gastritis, reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer, respectively. Significant differences in PGI, PGII, and PGI/II ratio values were observed among ethnic groups (all P < 0.01). The PGI and PGII levels were significantly higher and PGI/II was significantly lower in H. pylori-infected patients than in uninfected ones (all P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff value for PGII and PGI/II was 12.45 ng/mL with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.755 (0.702-0.811), sensitivity 59.3%, and specificity 77.1%; and 4.75 with AUC value of 0.821 (0.763-0.855), sensitivity 81.5%, and specificity 78.7%, respectively, to determine moderate-severe atrophy.

Considering that serum CD26 levels have been previously associated with different cancers, we examined the potential diagnostic value of serum CD26 levels in gastric cancer. Methods: Soluble serum CD26 levels were measured in pre and postoperative serum samples of 30 patients with gastric cancer and in 24 healthy donors by a specific ELISA kit. Results: We found significantly lower serum CD26 levels in patients with gastric cancer (557.7 +/- 118.3 pg/mL) compared with healthy donors (703.4 +/- 170.3 pg/mL). Moreover patients with HER2 positive tumors had significantly lower CD26 serum levels (511.8 +/- 84.8 pg/mL) compared with HER2 negative tumors (619.1 +/- 109.9 pg/mL, p = 0.006). A binary logistic model having gastric cancer as the dependent variable while age, gender, CEA, CA19.9 and CD26 levels as covariates, showed that CD26 serum levels were independently associated with gastric cancer presence.

Serum irisin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Results: Serum CEA increases significantly and serum irisin decreases significantly in gastric and colorectal cancer patients. According to Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, in gastric cancer, the area under curve of CEA is 1.00 (95% CI, 1.000-1.000, p< 0.0001). The diagnostic cut-off of CEA is< 3.08 ng/ml with %100 sensitivity and 100% specificity. The area under curve of irisin is 0.94 (95% CI, 0.8177-1.000, p< 0.0001). The cut-off of irisin is> 30.2 ng/ml with %90 sensitivity and 100%, specificity. In colorectal cancer, the area under curve of CEA is 0.99 (95% CI, 0.9866-1.000, p< 0.0001) and the diagnostic value< 2.6 ng/ml with %98 sensitivity and %100 specificity. The area under curve of irisin is 0.96 (95% CI, 0.9155-1.000, p< 0.0001). The diagnostic cut-off of irisin is> 41.9 ng/ml with 88.1sensitivity and 90.5 specificity. Conclusions: CEA and irisin could be powerful potential diagnostic biomarkers which would be use for early detection of gastric and colorectal cancers.",2021,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:56,,,,3,10,,Rep.

This study aims at evaluating the diagnostic value of fecal calprotectin as a screening biomarker for GI malignancies. Materials and Methods: In a case-control study, 100 patients with GI malignancies (50 patients with colorectal cancer and 50 patients with gastric cancer) and 50 controls were recruited in Tabriz Imam Reza and Sina hospitals during a 24-month period. One to two weeks after the last endoscopy/colonoscopy, fecal specimens were collected by the patients and examined by ELISA method for quantitative measurement of calprotectin content. The results were compared between the three groups. Results: The mean fecal calprotectin level was 109.1 +/- 105.3 (2.3-454.3, median: 74), 241.1 +/- 205.2 (3.4-610.0, median: 19.3) and 45.9 +/- 55.1 mu g/g (1.3-257.1, median: 19.3) in gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and control group, respectively, the differences being significant (p<0.001) and remaining after adjustment for age. The optimal cut-off point for fecal calprotectin was >= 75.8 mu g/g for distinguishing colorectal cancer from normal cases (sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 84%, respectively). This value was >= 41.9 mu g/g for distinguishing gastric cancer from normal cases (sensitivity and specificity of 62%). Conclusions: Our results revealed that fecal calprotectin might be a useful and non-invasive biomarker for distinguishing colorectal cancer from non-malignant GI conditions. However, due to low sensitivity and specificity, this biomarker may not help physicians distinguishing gastric cancer cases from healthy subjects.",2014,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:16,,1667-1670,,4,15,,Asian Pac.

Methods for enrichment and detection of CTCs and ctDNA, their clinical applications and future opportunities in gastrointestinal cancers were the focus of this review. Methods: The PubMed database was searched for literature up to 24 June 2017, with a focus on the past 10 years. Identified articles were further scrutinized for relevant references. Articles were those in English relating to colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer. Results: Both CTCs and ctDNA are in low abundance compared with other cellular components of blood, but effective enrichment and highly sensitive techniques are available for their detection. Potential clinical applications of these liquid biopsies include screening, prognostic stratification, therapy administration, monitoring of treatment effect or resistance, and surveillance.

We investigated salivary extracellular RNA (exRNA) biomarkers as potential clinical evaluation tools for GC. METHODS: Unstimulated whole saliva samples were prospectively collected from 294 individuals (163 GC and 131 non-GC patients) who underwent endoscopic evaluation at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea. Salivary transcriptomes of 63 GC and 31 non-GC patients were profiled, and mRNA biomarker candidates were verified with reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). In parallel, microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers were profiled and verified with saliva samples from 10 GC and 10 non-GC patients. Candidate biomarkers were validated with RT-qPCR in an independent cohort of 100/100 saliva samples from GC and non-GC patients. Validated individual markers were configured into a best performance panel. RESULTS: We identified 30 mRNA and 15 miRNA candidates whose expression pattern associated with the presence of GC. Among them, 12 mRNA and 6 miRNA candidates were verified with the discovery cohort by RT-qPCR and further validated with the independent cohort (n = 200). The configured biomarker panel consisted of 3 mRNAs (SPINK7, PPL, and SEMA4B) and 2 miRNAs (MIR140-5p and MIR301a), which were all significantly down-regulated in the GC group, and yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.89). When combined with demographic factors, the AUC of the biomarker panel reached 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: We have discovered and validated a panel of salivary exRNA biomarkers with credible clinical performance for the detection of GC. Our study demonstrates the potential utility of salivary exRNA biomarkers in screening and risk assessment for GC.

However, gastric cancer can develop even after successful eradication. Summary: In this review article, we searched for studies that identified the characteristics of primary and metachronous gastric cancers after H. pylori eradication, the risk factors for the development of these cancers after successful H. pylori eradication, and whether image-enhanced endoscopy is useful for diagnosing gastric cancer after eradication. A gastritis-like appearance is seen as a characteristic endoscopic finding, which corresponds to an epithelium with low-grade atypia - also known as nonneoplastic epithelium - covering the surface of the cancerous glands. This finding may make endoscopic detection of early gastric cancer difficult after H. pylori eradication. Similar risk factors, such as the male sex, endoscopic atrophy, histologic intestinal metaplasia, and late eradication, have been reported as predictors for the development of both primary and metachronous gastric cancers. Image-enhanced endoscopy, such as linked color imaging, may be useful for the detection and risk stratification of gastric cancer after eradication.

The role of AI in early gastric cancer is more important than in advanced gastric cancer since early gastric cancer is not easily identified in clinical practice. However, to our knowledge, past syntheses appear to have limited focus on the populations with early gastric cancer. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of AI in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer from endoscopic images. Methods: We conducted a systematic review from database inception to June 2020 of all studies assessing the performance of AI in the endoscopic diagnosis of early gastric cancer. Studies not concerning early gastric cancer were excluded. The outcome of interest was the diagnostic accuracy (comprising sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) of AI systems. Study quality was assessed on the basis of the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. Meta-analysis was primarily based on a bivariate mixed-effects model. A summary receiver operating curve and a hierarchical summary receiver operating curve were constructed, and the area under the curve was computed. Results: We analyzed 12 retrospective case control studies (n=11,685) in which AI identified early gastric cancer from endoscopic images. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI for early gastric cancer diagnosis were 0.86 (95% CI 0.75-0.92) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.93), respectively. The area under the curve was 0.94. Sensitivity analysis of studies using support vector machines and narrow-band imaging demonstrated more consistent results. Conclusions: For early gastric cancer, to our knowledge, this was the first synthesis study on the use of endoscopic images in AI in diagnosis. AI may support the diagnosis of early gastric cancer. However, the collocation of imaging techniques and optimal algorithms remain unclear. Competing models of AI for the diagnosis of early gastric cancer are worthy of future investigation.",2022/5/16,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,e27694,,5,24,,J. Med.

Methods: Existing literature was used to identify the item pool. Cluster analysis, focus groups, and cognitive interviewing were used to reduce collinear items and refine the questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which items distinguished gastric cancer cases from the primary care and community controls. Results: The results of analysis of data from 40 cases and 100 controls (primary care = 47; community = 53) were used to reduce the 227 item pool to 12 items. After ranking these variables using model bootstrapping, a logistic regression model using the highest ranked eight variables was chosen as the final model. Older age, foreign nativity, daily consumption of cultural food at ages 15-18, less than high-school education, and greater acculturation were significantly associated with being a gastric cancer case compared with the controls. Conclusions: An eight-item survey that addresses gastric cancer risk factors, ethnicity, cultural habits, and immigration patterns has potential to identify high-risk persons from multicultural areas within the US, who might benefit from endoscopic screening for gastric cancer.

Objective: This study aimed to identify the microRNAs(miRNAs) and their target genes and pathways responsible for angiogenesis in gastric cancer. Methods: From the public miRNA transcriptomic profiles of gastric cancer in three conditions (normal, adjacent to tumor, and tumor), we identified differentially expressed miRNAs that were commonlypresent in all the three conditions i.e. adjacent to tumor-normal [adj-nor],tumor-adjacent to tumor [tum-adj], and tumor-normal [tumnor].The target genes of those miRNAs were predicted and subjected to network analysis. The resultant subnetwork clusters were annotated with functional enrichment analysis and pathway analysis to identify potential genes and pathways related to angiogenesis in gastric cancer. Result: This study identified two miRNAs (miR-196a-5p and miR-223-3p), 12 genes (IL6, SP1, STAT3, FBXW7, STAT1, STAT5A, ZEB1, HMOX1, CCND1, CDKN1B, GLMN, and PRDM1) and one pathway (FoxO signaling pathway) related to angiogenesis in gastric cancer. Among these 12 genes, five genes (HMOX1, CCND1, CDKN1B, GLMN, and PRDM1) were first reported in our study for their role in tumor angiogenesis in gastric cancer.

However, the biological function and clinical significance of hsa_circ_0005927 during gastric carcinogenesis remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the acting mechanism and clinical significance of hsa_circ_0005927 in the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer (GC). Methods: Hsa_circ_0005927 was detected in GC tissues, plasma and gastric juice from patients with GC, and its correlations with clinicopathological parameters were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic curves, Kaplan -Meier survival curves and a prognostic nomogram model were generated to analyze the diagnostic and prognostic value. Real -time cell analyzer, plate colony formation, and Transwell migration and invasion assays were utilized to assess GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively. Nucleoplasmic separation was applied to determine the distribution of hsa_circ_0005927 in cells. TargetScan and miRanda software were used for target microRNA (miRNA) prediction. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed to annotate the functions of hsa_circ_0005927 in gastric carcinogenesis and metastasis from an RNomic perspective. Key target genes and immune cell infiltrations were analysed. Results: Hsa_circ_0005927 was found downregulated in high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIEN) tissues and GC tissues. Hsa_circ_0005927 levels in GC tissues were negatively correlated not only with lymphatic metastasis and distal metastasis but also with overall surfvival and disease-free survival. As a screening biomarker for GC, plasma hsa_circ_0005927 levels significantly increased in the early stages of GC, with a sensitivity and specificity of 52.38% and 76.19%, respectively. Hsa_circ_0005927 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, and structurally, it possesses multiple miRNA response elements (MREs) that interact with five miRNAs. A total of 421 downstream target genes of hsa_circ_0005927 were identified by transcriptome sequencing; and bioinformatics analysis suggested that these genes were involved mainly in the negative regulation of the T-cell apoptotic process, the interleukin-27-mediated signaling pathway, growth factor activity, guanylate cyclase activity, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and the GnRH signaling pathway during gastric carcinogenesis and metastasis.

Therefore, this study analyzed predictive factors associated with lymph node metastasis and identified differences between mucosal and submucosal gastric cancers. Materials and Methods: A total of 518 early gastric cancer patients who underwent radical gastrectomy were reviewed in this study. Clinicopathological features were analyzed to identify predictive factors for lymph node metastasis. Results: The rate of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer was 15.3% overall, 3.3% for mucosal cancer, and 23.5% for submucosal cancer. Using univariate analysis, risk factors for lymph node metastasis were identified as tumor location, tumor size, depth of tumor invasion, histological type and lymphovascular invasion. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size >2 cm, submucosal invasion, undifferentiated tumors and lymphovascular invasion were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis. When the carcinomas were confined to the mucosal layer, tumor size showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastasis. On the other hand, histological type and lymphovascular invasion were associated with lymph node metastasis in submucosal carcinomas. Conclusions: Tumor size >2 cm, submucosal tumor, undifferentiated tumor and lymphovascular invasion are predictive factors for lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. Risk factors are quite different depending on depth of tumor invasion.

Reliable prognostic biomarkers are still needed due to the disease heterogeneity. Increasing pieces of evidence revealed an association between immune signature and GC prognosis. Thus, we aim to build an immune-related signature that can estimate prognosis for GC. Methods: For identification of a prognostic immune-related gene signature (IRGS), gene expression profiles and clinical information of patients with GC were collected from 3 public cohorts, divided into training cohort (n=300) and 2 independent validation cohorts (n=277 and 433 respectively). Results: Within 1811 immune genes, a prognostic IRGS consisting of 16 unique genes was constructed which was significantly associated with survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9 [2.78-5.47]; P < 1.0 x 10(-22)). In the validation cohorts, the IRGS significantly stratified patients into high-vs low-risk groups in terms of prognosis across (HR, 1.84 [1.47-2.30]; P = 6.59 x 10(-8)) and within subpopulations with stage I&II disease (HR, 1.96 [1.34-2.89]; P = 4.73 x 10(-4)) and was prognostic in univariate and multivariate analyses. Several biological processes, including TGF-beta and EMT signaling pathways, were enriched in the high-risk group.

We aimed to test whether tongue coating microbiome was associated with GC risk. Methods: Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene of tongue coating microbiome was used in 57 newly diagnosed gastric adenocarcinomas and 80 healthy controls. Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) was applied for multiple comparison correction. Co-abundance group (CAGs) analysis was adopted. Results: We found that higher relative abundance of Firmicutes, and lower of Bacteroidetes were associated with increased risk of GC. In genus level, Streptococcus trended with a higher risk of GC, the four other genera (Neisseria, Prevotella, Prevotella7, and Porphyromonas) were found to have a decreased risk of GC. Different from overall GC and non-cardia cancer, Alloprevotella and Veillonella trended with the higher risk of cardia cancer. Finally, we analyzed the microbiota by determining CAGs and six clusters were identified. Except the Cluster 2 (mainly Streptococcus and Abiotrophia), the other clusters had an inverse association with GC. Of them, the Cluster 6 (mainly Prevotella and Prevotella7 etc) had a relatively good classification power with 0.76 of AUC.

The optimal screening interval of endoscopic screening in Japan was investigated based on the stage distributions of screen-detected gastric cancers. Methods: Patients with gastric cancer detected by endoscopic and radiographic screenings were selected from the Niigata City Medical Association database. The stage distributions of the detected gastric cancers were compared among patients with different screening histories in both groups. Gastric cancer specific survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. Results: There were 1585 and 462 subjects in the endoscopic and radiographic screening groups, respectively. In the endoscopic screening group, the stage IV proportion was lower in patients with screening history 1 and 2 years before diagnosis than in patients without screening history. Stage IV development was significantly related to the absence of screening history (p < 0.001); however, there were no differences between patients who had endoscopic screening history 2 and 3 years before diagnosis. The survival rates were not significantly different between patients with endoscopic screening 1 and 2 years previously (p = 0.7763). The survival rates were significantly higher in patients with endoscopic screening history 1 and 2 years before diagnosis than in patients without screening history (p < 0.001), and in patients with endoscopic screaming 3 years before diagnosis (P < 0.0069).

Herein we have developed a robust gene-expression signature for detecting LN metastasis in early stage GC by using a transcriptome-wide biomarker discovery and subsequent validation in multiple clinical cohorts. Methods: A total of 532 patients with pathological T1 and T2 GC from 4 different cohorts were analyzed. Two independent datasets (n= 96, and n= 188) were used to establish a gene signature for the identification of LN metastasis in GC patients. The diagnostic performance of our gene-expression signature was subsequently assessed in two independent clinical cohorts using qRT-PCR assays (n= 101, and n= 147), and subsequently compared against conventional tumor markers and image-based diagnostics. Findings: We established a 15-gene signature by analyzing multiple high throughput datasets, which robustly distinguished LN status in both training (AUC= 0.765, 95% CI 0.667-0.863) and validation cohorts (AUC= 0.742, 95% CI 0.630-0.852). Notably, the 15-gene signature was significantly superior compared to the conventional tumor markers, CEA (P=.04) and CA19-9 (P=.005), as well as computed tomography-based imaging (P=.04). Interpretation: Wehave established and validated a 15-gene signature for detecting LN metastasis in GC patients, which offers a robust diagnostic tool for potentially improving treatment outcomes in gastric cancer patients.

Aim: We aimed to estimate the magnitude of the risk of gastric cancer associated with H. pylori infection by a large case-control study nested within a prospective cohort. Possible effect modification by CagA status, and serum pepsinogen status, as a marker of atrophic gastritis, was also considered to see its effect on developing gastric cancer. Subjects and Methods: Subjects (n = 123,576) were followed up from 1990 to 2004; 511 gastric cancer cases matched to 511 controls were used in the analysis. Plasma immunoglobulin G antibody to H. pylori, CagA, and pepsinogen I and II were measured. Results: The adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of gastric cancer associated with H. pylori infection was 5.1 (3.2-8.0). Assuming all CagA-positive subjects are true H. pylori positives doubled this risk. Atrophic gastritis was also associated with an elevated risk of gastric cancer and the risk increased further with pepsinogen levels. Conclusions: Subjects with pepsinogen levels indicative of severe atrophic gastritis may need careful examination regularly regardless of H. pylori infection. Those who have other pepsinogen levels but who are H. pylori seropositive are likely to benefit from H. pylori eradication therapy. Considering both the cost and the potential for misclassification that may occur using multiple serologic tests, caution is needed in interpreting or extrapolating these findings into a screening strategy.",Jul-06,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:20,,1341-1347,,7,15,,Cancer Epidemiol.

The characterization of gastric cancer has necessitated the development of new therapeutics as well as the identification of prognostic markers to predict the response to novel drugs. In our study, we used RNA sequencing analyses to show that on gastric cancer tissues to identification of gastric cancer prognostic markers. We specifically chose to study RNF43 because it inhibits gastric cancer-related Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by interacting with Wnt receptors. PWWP2B was chosen because it is a gene which is downregulated in gastric cancer. Methods: Utilizing RNA sequencing analysis, we evaluated the mRNA expression profile in gastric cancer patients. Also, we used HAP1 cells which is a human near-haploid cell line derived from the male chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line KBM-7. These cell line has one copy of each gene, ensuring the edited allele will not be masked by additional alleles. We investigated the screening of 1,449 FDA-approved drugs in HAP1, HAP1 RNF43 KO and HAP1 PWWP2B KO cells. RNA sequencing data reveals that RNF43 and PWWP2B expression were down-regulated in recurrence gastric cancer patients. Next, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of selected drugs in RNF43 and PWWP2B down-regulated MKN45 gastric cancer cells and xenograft model. Results: Among these FDA-approved drugs, three drugs (docetaxel trihydrate, pelitinib and uprosertib) showed strong inhibitory effects in RNF43 KO cells and PWWP2B KO cells. In MKN45 xenograft model, tumor volumes were significantly reduced in the docetaxel trihydrate, uprosertib or pelitinib-treated group. Our data demonstrated that RNF43 and PWWP2B are a biomarker that predict recurrence of gastric cancer. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that docetaxel trihydrate, uprosertib and pelitinib could be used as novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer with a decrease in RNF43 and PWWP2B expression.",2021,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:56,,,,15,12,,J.

This study was to explore the values of serum tumor abnormal protein (TAP), an abnormal glycochain protein, in the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: A total of 335 GC patients were included as the study group. and another 335 subjects served as the control group. Tumor abnormal protein expression was compared between the 2 groups. Correlation analysis was used to assess the correlations of TAP with clinicopathological factors. Gastric cancer patients were divided into training set and test set at a ratio of 2:1. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses in training set were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of TAP in GC patients and explore the independent risk factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) to establish a prognostic model. followed by testing of the model. According to the median of TAP, 335 GC patients were divided into 2 groups to plot the survival curves of OS and DFS. RESULTS: Tumor abnormal protein expression in the study group was significantly higher than in the control group. Taking the best cut-off value of TAP (110.128 mu m(2)) as the diagnostic criteria for GC, the sensitivity and specificity of TAP were 83.58% and 97.61%. respectively, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was 0.935, which was not inferior to computed tomography (CT). Tumor abnormal protein expression was an independent risk factor for OS and DFS. The prognostic predictive value of TAP was better than that of pathological stage in GC patients. The model with TAP was effective in predicting prognosis.

However, the manual detection of EGC is a costly and low-accuracy task. The artificial intelligence (AI) method based on deep learning is considered as a potential method to detect EGC. AI methods have outperformed endoscopists in EGC detection, especially with the use of the different region convolutional neural network (RCNN) models recently reported. However, no studies compared the performances of different RCNN series models. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the performances of different RCNN series models for EGC. METHODS: Three typical RCNN models were used to detect gastric cancer using 3659 gastroscopic images, including 1434 images of EGC: Faster RCNN, Cascade RCNN, and Mask RCNN. RESULTS: The models were evaluated in terms of specificity, accuracy, precision, recall, and AP. Fast RCNN, Cascade RCNN, and Mask RCNN had similar accuracy (0.935, 0.938, and 0.935). The specificity of Cascade RCNN was 0.946, which was slightly higher than 0.908 for Faster RCNN and 0.908 for Mask RCNN. CONCLUSION: Faster RCNN and Mask RCNN place more emphasis on positive detection, and Cascade RCNN places more emphasis on negative detection.

We aimed to analyze the association of TFFs with gastric cancer and PMLs in a general population. Methods: We evaluated 3,986 adults residing in Wuwei, China. We collected baseline characteristics and gastric cancer risk factors, including TFFs, endoscopic diagnosis, and pathologic information. Three logistic regression models were generated to analyze the association between TFFs and gastric cancer, as well as PMLs. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to determine the strength of association. Results: Compared with pepsinogen (PG) and anti-Helicobacter pylori immunoglobulin G antibody (Hp-IgG), TFFs had significant association with gastric cancer and PMLs after adjusting for biomarkers and risk factors (P < 0.05). The ORs (95% CI) for TFF1 (1.67; 1.27-2.20), TFF2 (2.66; 2.01-3.51), and TFF3 (1.32; 1.00-1.74) were larger than the ORs for PGI (0.79; 0.61-1.03), PGI/II (1.00; 0.76-1.31), and Hp-IgG (0.99; 0.73-1.35) in the gastric cancer group. In the intestinal metaplasia (IM) group, not only the TFF3 serum level was the highest, but also the OR (1.92; 1.64-2.25) was the highest.

Endoscopy rates are increasing. Helicobacter pylori infection is a major GC risk factor. In an effort to elucidate abundant blood biomarkers, and potentially reduce the number of diagnostic surgical interventions, we investigated sera and biopsies from a cohort of 219 H. pylori positive and negative patients diagnosed with GC, gastritis, and ulcers. This allowed the comparative investigation of the different gastroduodenal diseases, and the exclusion of protein changes resulting from bacterial infection or inflammation of the gastric mucosa when searching for GC-dependent proteins. Methods: High-definition mass spectrometry-based expression analysis of tryptically digested proteins was performed, followed by multivariate statistical and network analyses for the different disease groups, with respect to H. pylori infection status. Significantly regulated proteins differing more than two-fold between groups were shortlisted, and their role in gastritis and GC discussed. Results: We present data of comparative protein analyses of biopsies and sera from patients suffering from mild to advanced gastritis, ulcers, and early to advanced GC, in conjunction with a wealth of metadata, clinical information, histopathological evaluation, and H. pylori infection status. We used samples from pre-malignant stages to extract prospective serum markers for early-stage GC, and present a 29-protein marker panel containing, amongst others, integrin beta-6 and glutathione peroxidase. Furthermore, ten serum markers specific for advanced GC, independent of H. pylori infection, are provided. They include CRP, protein S100A9, and kallistatin. The majority of these proteins were previously discussed in the context of cancer or GC. In addition, we detected hypoalbuminemia and increased fibrinogen serum levels in gastritis. Conclusion: Two protein panels were suggested for the development of multiplex tests for GC serum diagnostics. For most of the elements contained in these panels, individual commercial tests are available. Thus, we envision the design of multi-protein assays, incorporating several to all of the panel members, in order to gain a level of specificity that cannot be achieved by testing a single protein alone. As their development and validation will take time, gastritis diagnosis based on the fibrinogen to albumin serum ratio may be a quick way forward. Its determination at the primary/secondary care level for early diagnosis could significantly reduce the number of referrals to endoscopy. Preventive measures are in high demand. The protein marker panels presented in this work will contribute to improved GC diagnostics, once they have been transferred from a research result to a practical tool.",May-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,2857,,9,27,,Molecules,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 25 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000794742500001,,,,BIOMARKERS; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI INFECTION; IDENTIFICATION; gastric cancer; EXPRESSION; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; PATHWAY; Helicobacter pylori; GENES; proteomics; gastritis; CANDIDATE; ACQUISITION; CHAIN; ulcer; 335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the association between ghrelin and gastroesophageal cancers and atrophic gastritis in a population-based setting. Methods: In total 220 gastroesophageal cancers, comprising non-cardia and cardia gastric cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and age and gender-matched controls were recruited. Serum ghrelin, pepsinogen I/II ratio (PGI/II) and anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies were measured. Relationships between ghrelin and gastroesophageal cancers, after adjustment for PGI/II ratio, H. pylori status and smoking, were tested using logistic regression. Furthermore, in 125 endoscopically normal volunteers, with and without histological atrophic gastritis, the relationship with ghrelin was compared. Results: Serum ghrelin (lowest vs. highest quintile) was inversely associated with gastric cancer: OR (95% CI) 8.71 (1.70-44.59) for cardia and 6.58 (1.26-34.46) for non-cardia cancer. Lower serum ghrelin was also associated with esophageal SCC: OR (95% CI) 5.69 (1.36-23.78), but not with esophageal adenocarcinoma. A similar association was observed between gastric cancer (cardia and non-cardia) and esophageal SCC when serum ghrelin was analysed as a continuous scaled variable. In endoscopically-normal volunteers, extensive atrophic gastritis was associated with low serum ghrelin [OR (95% CI) 0.25 (0.10-0.64)]. Conclusion: Inverse associations between ghrelin and some gastroesophageal cancers suggest a potential role for serum ghrelin as a biomarker of upper gastrointestinal cancers and atrophic gastritis. In areas with a high incidence of gastric and/or esophageal cancer, screening might be more effectively targeted to individuals with low serum ghrelin in addition to the PGI/II ratio.",2013/9/30,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:16,,e74440,,9,8,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 7 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000325423500021,,,,HELICOBACTER-PYLORI INFECTION; ADENOCARCINOMA; SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; ESOPHAGEAL CANCER; JAPAN; ATROPHY; 2 DISTINCT ETIOLOGIES; CARDIA CANCER; INCREASED RISK-FACTOR; SEROLOGICAL MARKERS; 1092,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trial design and baseline findings are presented here. Methods: A total of 33 eligible villages in Luoshan County in Henan Province were assigned randomly to the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio by a computer-generated randomization list. Local residents aged 40 to 69 years were enrolled from the villages. Participants in the intervention group were risk-stratified with a questionnaire, and high-risk individuals were subsequently screened by endoscopy. The primary outcomes were EC and GC mortality. The secondary outcomes comprised the detection rate, stage distribution, and the treatment rate. In this study, baseline characteristics were assessed by a questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore factors associated with endoscopy compliance. Results: Trial recruitment was completed in 2017, and ultimately, there were 12,475 and 11,442 participants allocated to the intervention (17 clusters) and the control group (16 clusters), respectively. We included 23,653 participants in the analysis, with 12,402 in the intervention group and 11,251 in the control group. A total of 6,286 (50.7%) participants in the intervention group were estimated as high-risk individuals, and 2,719 (43.3%) underwent endoscopy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that some factors including age, gender, education, personality and mental health, and upper gastrointestinal diseases or symptoms might affect endoscopy compliance. The detection rates for positive cases of EC and GC were 0.22% and 0.55%, respectively. The rates for esophageal and gastric precancerous lesions were 0.70% and 2.35%, respectively. The early detection rates for EC and GC were 50.0% and 33.3%, respectively. Additionally, the overall treatment rate for positive cases was 90.0%. Conclusions: The diagnostic yield of endoscopy-based screening for EC and GC was relatively low in a non-high-incidence rural area. The study may offer clues for the improvement of endoscopy compliance and the optimization of screening strategies for upper gastrointestinal cancer in non-high-incidence areas.",Sep-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:55,,994,,18,10,,ANN.

For example, while the anti-ERBB2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, was first developed using well -characterized, diverse in vitro breast cancer models (and is now a standard adjuvant therapy for ERBB2-positive breast cancer patients), trastuzumab approval for ERBB2-positive gastric cancer was largely based on preclinical studies of a single cell line, NCI-N87. Ensuing clinical trials revealed only modest patient efficacy, and many ERBB2-positive gastric cancer (GC) patients failed to respond at all (i.e., were inherently recalcitrant), or succumbed to acquired resistance. Method: To assess mechanisms underlying GC insensitivity to ERBB2 therapies, we established a diverse panel of GC cells, differing in ERBB2 expression levels, for comprehensive in vitro and in vivo characterization. For higher throughput assays of ERBB2 DNA and protein levels, we compared the concordance of various laboratory quantification methods, including those of in vitro and in vivo genetic anomalies (FISH and SISH) and xenograft protein expression (Western blot vs. IHC), of both cell and xenograft (tissue-sectioned) microarrays. Results: The biomarker assessment methods strongly agreed, as did correlation between RNA and protein expression. However, although ERBB2 genomic anomalies showed good in vitro vs. in vivo correlation, we observed striking differences in protein expression between cultured cells and mouse xenografts (even within the same GC cell type). Via our unique pathway analysis, we delineated a signaling network, in addition to specific pathways/biological processes, emanating from the ERBB2 signaling cascade, as a potential useful target of clinical treatment. Integrated analysis of public data from gastric tumors revealed frequent (10 20 Sc') amplification of the genes NFKB1E, PTK2, and PIK3CA, each of which resides in an ERBB2-derived subpathway network. Conclusion: Our comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of highly heterogeneous cancer cells, combined with tumor ""omics"" profiles, can optimally characterize the expression patterns and activity of specific tumor biomarkers. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo validation, of specific disease biomarkers (using multiple methodologies), can improve prediction of patient stratification according to drug response or nonresponse.",2016/3/9,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:12,,200,,1,16,,BMC Cancer,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 13 Place: London Publisher: BMC Web of Science ID: WOS:000371672100001,,,,Biomarker; BREAST-CANCER; GENE AMPLIFICATION; CELL-LINES; HER2; ANTITUMOR-ACTIVITY; Trastuzumab; GROWTH-FACTOR; DRUG-RESISTANCE; Cell microarray; ERBB2 expression; Gastric cancer cell es; PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION; Targeted therapies; TRASTUZUMAB; Tumor heterogeneity; Xenograft microarray; XENOGRAFT MODELS; 928,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate the predictors for the detection of HP-negative EGG. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 13,477 consecutive asymptomatic cases where upper endoscopy was performed by nine physicians from April 2017 to March 2019 and analyzed the detection rate of high-risk lesions (HRLs), including EGC:, tubular adenoma, and lymphoma, according to the status of HP infection. The observation time was corrected for multiple regression analyses. Results: For all physicians, the average observation time for screening HP-eradicated and -naive patients was shorter than that for screening HP-positive patients (p<0.05). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the observation time in the three groups was an independent predictor for detecting HRLs in HP-eradicated patients (p=0.03106, 0.01263, and 0.02485, respectively), while experience of endoscopy was an independent predictor for detecting HRLs in HP-naive patients (p=0.02638).

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of H. pylori eradication on the regression of gastric hyperplastic polyps in National Cancer Screening Cohort, representative of general population. Methods: Among participants in National Cancer Screening Program, subjects who had H. pylori positive gastric hyperplastic polyps less than 10 mm and underwent follow-up endoscopy and H. pylori testing were enrolled. The effect of H. pylori eradication on hyperplastic gastric polyps was estimated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 183 H. pylori infected subjects with hyperplastic polyp at baseline underwent follow-up endoscopy and H. pylori test after mean of 2.2 years.

METHODS: We reviewed 393 EGCs with differentiated histology from 380 patients who underwent EUS from July 2007 to April 2010. The effectiveness of the EUS-based and endoscopy-based plans was evaluated using a simplified hypothetical treatment algorithm. RESULTS: The numbers of endoscopically determined mucosal, indeterminate, and submucosal cancers were 253 (64.4%), 56 (14.2%), and 84 (21.4%), respectively. Overall, the appropriate treatment selection rates were 75.3% (296/393) in the endoscopy-based plan and 71.5% (281/393) in the EUS-based plan (p=0.184). For endoscopic mucosal cancers, the appropriate treatment selection rates in the endoscopy-based plan were 88.1% (223/253), while the use of an EUS-based plan significantly decreased this rate to 81.4% (206/253) (p=0.036). For endoscopic submucosal cancers, the appropriate selection rates did not differ between the endoscopy-based plan (46.4%, 39/84) and the EUS-based plan (53.6%, 45/84) (p=0.070). CONCLUSIONS: EUS did not increase the likelihood of selecting the appropriate treatment in differentiated-type EGC.

Methods: The study participants were 29 patients with differentiated-type EGC. The endoscope was fixed and images of the same area of EGC demarcations in each lesion were obtained using four different methods (WLE, flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (FICE), CE, and I-FICE). FICE mode at R 550 nm (Gain: 2), G 500 nm (Gain: 4), and B 470 nm (Gain: 4) was used. Four endoscopists ranked the images obtained by each method on the basis of the ease of recognition of demarcation using a 4-point system. We calculated the standard deviation of pixel values based on L*, a*, and b* color spaces in the demarcation region (Lab-SD score). Results: The median ranking score for I-FICE images was significantly higher than that obtained from the other methods. Further, the average Lab-SD score was significantly higher for I-FICE images than for images obtained by the other methods. There was a good correlation between the ranking score and Lab-SD score.

Methodology: Gene expression profile of GSE29272 was downloaded from Gene expression omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at the cut-off of p-value <= 0.01. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was further performed for the DEGs, and then the binding sites of the transcriptional factors and the specific protein-protein interactions were analyzed. Results: Total 1024 DEGs were screened, including 741 up-regulated genes and 283 down-regulated genes. VSNL1 (visinin-like protein-1) is expressed relatively higher in the GNCA and could be its molecular biomarker, as KRT14 (cytokeratin 14) in the GCA.

METHODOLOGY: cDNA microarray data were obtained from 10 pair of cancerous and normal adjacent tissue from gastric adenocarcinoma patients. The samples were divided in primary and advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastasis. Validation of the microarray data was accomplished by quantitative RT-PCR on additional 41 samples. The significantly modified genes were grouped in clusters according to their functional annotation, and comparison was done regarding molecular mechanisms involved tumor progression. RESULTS: A total of 136 genes were up-regulated and 96 genes were down-regulated by at least fourfold in tumor tissue. The analysis of gene clusters revealed a complex remodelling of normal gastric epithelium morphology and function associated with the tumorigenesis and metastasis. A large number of proteases are being overexpressed, together with keratins, genes associated with morphogenesis and anti-apoptosis. Between the most significant down-regulated genes, there were genes involved in gastric motility and synthesis and genes related to metabolic and pro-apoptotic processes. We also report, the identification of seven genes, significant up-regulated, that seem to be associated with tumor progression: KRT17, COL10A2, KIAA1199, SPP1, IL11, S100A2, and MMP3. CONCLUSIONS: Our cDNA microarray study identified several genes that appeared to meet the criteria of a good biomarker, and may therefore be especially useful for the development of diagnostic tools, for the early detection, or for the prediction of tumor progression.",2010,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:56,,,,104,57,,Hepatogastroenterology.,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 1453-64 Place: PO BOX 17257, ATHENS GR-10024, GREECE Publisher: H G E Update Medical Publishing S A Web of Science ID: 21443102",,,,Gastric cancer; Biomarkers; Gene expression; Tumorigenesis; Metastasis; 1358,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to define the role of sPG, especially sPGII, in GC screening. Methods: This study enrolled 2,940 subjects, including patients with GC (n=1,124) or gastric dysplasia (n=353) and controls (n=1,463). Tests to determine sPG levels and Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection status were performed. Area under the curve and receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated to identify the optimal cutoff values for sPG. The usefulness of sPG levels for the detection of GC and gastric dysplasia was validated by multivariate logistic regression. Results: The sPGI/II ratio was associated with the risk of gastric dysplasia and advanced-stage intestinal-type GC (IGC). In contrast, sPGII was associated with the risk of early-stage diffuse-type GC (DGC). Significantly higher risk was indicated by an sPGI/II ratio <3 for gastric dysplasia and advanced-stage IGC and by sPGII levels >= 20 mu g/L for early-stage DGC. Positive HP status showed a stronger association with DGC than with IGC. When sPGII level and HP status were combined, the prevalence of DGC was higher in the >= 20 mu g/L sPGII and HP-positive group. Age younger than 40 years was strongly related to early-stage DGC, especially in females (odds ratio, 21.00: p=0.006). Conclusions: sPGII >= 20 ng/mL and positive HP status suggest a risk of earlystage DGC, particularly in young adult females in South Korea.",Jul-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:02,,439-449,,4,14,,Gut Liver,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 11 Place: Seoul Publisher: Editorial Office Gut & Liver Web of Science ID: WOS:000550767400007,,,,RISK; Pepsinogen; Stomach neoplasms; EXPRESSION; CARCINOGENESIS; ERADICATION; Helicobacter pylori; CARCINOMA; METHYLATION; CHRONIC ATROPHIC GASTRITIS; INFECTION; Diffuse type; E-CADHERIN GENE; MULTISTEP; 564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This prospective, multicenter study evaluated 114 gastric lesions examined using M-BLI, M-BLI-bright, and M-NBI between May 2012 and November 2012; 104 EGCs were evaluated by each modality. The vessel plus surface classification system was used to evaluate the demarcation line (DL), microvascular pattern (MVP), and microsurface pattern (MSP). Results: M-BLI, MBLI- bright, and M-NBI revealed a DL for 96.1, 98.1, and 98.1% and irregular MVP for 95.1, 95.1, and 96.2% of lesions, respectively, with no significant difference. Irregular MSP was observed by M-BLI, M-BLI-bright, and M-NBI in 97.1, 90.4, and 78.8% of lesions, respectively, with significant differences (p < 0.001). The proportion of moderately differentiated ad-enocarcinoma with irregular MSP on M-BLI and absent MSP on M-NBI was significantly higher than that with irregular MSP on M-BLI and M-NBI (35.0 and 9.9%, respectively; p = 0.002). Conclusion: M-BLI and M-BLI-bright provided excellent visualization of microstructures and microvessels similar to M-NBI. Irregular MSP in a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma might be frequently visualized using M-BLI and M-BLI-bright compared with using M-NBI. (C) 2017 S.

Methods: The MS and MV patterns of 160 lesions in 160 patients with EGC who underwent ME-NBI before endoscopic or surgical resection were prospectively collected and analyzed. EGCs were categorized as either differentiated or undifferentiated and as either mucosal or submucosal, and their mucin phenotypes were determined via immunohistochemistry of the tumor specimens. Results: Differentiated tumors mainly displayed an oval and/or tubular MS pattern and a fine network or loop MV pattern, whereas undifferentiated tumors mainly displayed an absent MS pattern and a corkscrew MV pattern. The destructive MS pattern was associated with submucosal invasion, and this association was more prominent in the differentiated tumors than. in the undifferentiated tumors. MUC5AC expression was increased in lesions with either a papillary or absent MS pattern and a corkscrew MV pattern, whereas MUC6 expression was increased in lesions with a papillary MS pattern and a loop MV pattern.

We aimed to assess the effect, burden, and cost of the QA program from the viewpoint of medical institutions. METHODS: We surveyed the staff of institutional endoscopic units via e-mail. RESULTS: Staff members from 67 institutions replied. Most doctors were endoscopic specialists. They responded as to whether the QA program raised awareness for endoscopic quality (93%) or improved endoscopic practice (40%).

Although patients in developing countries have digestive symptoms for some time, they do not undergo early endoscopy. The patients refer to physicians in developed stages. This research was conducted to determine the median time of delay from the beginning of symptoms to surgery. METHODS: In this research, 63 patients suffering from gastric cancer were investigated during 2004-2005. A research questionnaire was completed from patient's admission to endoscopy until surgery through patient interview. Mann-Whitney statistical test and SPSS software were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Out of 63 patients, 48 (76.2%) were male and 43 (68.3%) were rural residents. The most common cancer area was cardia (31 patients) and the most common symptom was abdominal pain (28 patients). The results showed that the median total delay from the beginning of symptoms until surgery was 96 days. Median patient delay [from first symptom to presentation to general practitioner] was determined as 8 days, general practitioner delay (from the first referral to endoscopy) as 57 days, pathologist delay (from endoscopy to pathology confirmation) as 12 days, and surgeon delay (from pathology confirmation to surgery) as 7 days. Factors such as place of residence, education, income and gender had no significant effect on time of delay. CONCLUSIONS: Delays from referral to endoscopy performance and from performance of endoscopy to pathologic confirmation were higher than expected. A screening plan for timely referral of patients and performance of endoscopy seems essential. To reduce the time of delay, efforts such as physician education, cooperation between hospital units and pathologists and provision of necessary hospital equipment are highly recommended.",2007,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:55,,,,2,18,,Turk J Gastroenterol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 77-81 Place: GAZILER SOKAK 22-1, ABIDINPASA, ANKARA 06620, TURKEY Publisher: Turkish Soc Gastroenterology Web of Science ID: 17602354",,,,gastric cancer; diagnosis; 1360; surgical treatment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Among 100 lesions of differentiated-type early gastric cancer resected endoscopically, 34 lesions in the Hp-eradicated group and 66 in the Hp-infected group were retrospectively compared. Clinicopathological factors and ME-NBI findings, including the presence or absence of the DL, were examined. Histopathologically, histological gastritis, the surface structure at the tumor border, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with low-grade atypia (tub1-low), and non-neoplastic epithelium (NE) coverage rate on the tumor surface and at the tumor border were evaluated. Results: DL (-) cases were more frequent in the Hp-eradicated group (11.8%, 4/34) than in the Hp-infected group (1.5%, 1/66; p < 0.05).

Magnifying endoscopy with narrow -band imaging (ME-NBI) can improve diagnostic accuracy. We assess the efficacy of ME-NBI in diagnosing ECG and precancerous lesions, especially some characteristics under NBI + ME. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 131 patients with EGC or gastric intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) who had undergone endoscopic submucosal dissection and were pathologically diagnosed with EGC or IN according to 2019 WHO criteria for gastrointestinal tract tumors. We studied the characteristics of lesions under ME-NBI, compared the diagnostic efficacy of ME-NBI and white light endoscopy (WLI) plus biopsy, and investigated the effect of Helicobacter pylori infection on microvascular and microsurface pattern. Results: The diagnostic accuracy of ME-NBI for EGC, high-grade IN (HGIN), and low-grade IN (LGIN) was 76.06%, 77.96%, and 77.06%, respectively. The accuracy of WLI plus biopsy in diagnosing the above lesions was 69.7%, 57.5%, and 60.53%, respectively. The rate of gyrus-like tubular pattern was highest in LGIN (60.46%), whereas the highest rate of papillary pattern was 57.14% in HGIN and villous tubular pattern was 52% in EGC. Demarcation lines have better sensitivity for differentiating EGC from IN (92.06%). Conclusion: The ME-NBI has higher diagnostic accuracy for EGC than WLI plus biopsy.

We investigated the clinical characteristics and prognosis of diffuse-type early gastric cancer (EGC) diagnosed in subjects during health check-ups. Methods: Among 121,111 subjects who underwent gastroscopy during a routine health checkup, we identified 282 patients with 286 EGC lesions and reviewed their clinical and tumor-specific parameters. Results: Patients with diffuse-type EGC were younger, and 48.1% of them were female. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG (Hp-IgG) was positive in 90.7% of diffuse-type EGC patients (vs 75.9% of intestinal-type EGC, p=0.002), and the proportion of diffuse-type EGC cases increased significantly with increasing Hp-IgG serum titers (p<0.001). Diffuse-type EGC had pale discolorations on the tumor surface (26.4% vs 4.0% in intestinal-type EGC, p<0.001) and were often located in the middle third of the stomach. Submucosal invasion or regional nodal metastasis was observed more commonly in patients with diffuse-type EGC.

Thus, the aim of this study was to understand the results of gastric ulcer surveillance endoscopy and to individualize surveillance endoscopy by analyzing known risk factors for gastric cancer. Materials and Methods: In total, 599 (M: F=424: 175, median age=55.4 years) patients who were diagnosed with a gastric ulcer and who underwent follow-up endoscopy between January 2003 and August 2014 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The final results and risk factors of follow-up endoscopy were analyzed. Results: Multivariate analysis of the data between the benign and malignant ulcer groups (benign: malignant=575: 24) showed that an elevated border and irregular margins, among other risk factors, were significant indicators of malignancy (p<0.05). Of the 599 patients, 15 (2.5%) were histologically malignant based on the first biopsy results. Nine (1.5%) patients had malignant ulcers on surveillance endoscopy, and all nine were found to have atypia or dysplasia on the first biopsy. Eight of the nine patients had malignant endoscopic features.

Investigation of prognostic factors of gastric cancer disease seems to be still very important. The authors present a clinicopathological study based on the analysis of 49 gastric carcinomas. METHODOLOGY: P53 overexpression and proliferation activity of the cells were examined by immunohistological method with peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. The percentage of the positive cells was calculated after counting of 300 tumor cells in each case. The rate of the labeled cells was related to different pathological characteristics of the carcinomas i.e., TNM stage of the tumor, histological subtypes of Ming's as well as Lauren's and Goseki's classification respectively, grade of differentiation and lymph node status. RESULTS: According to the above-mentioned parameters, p53 overexpression was significantly higher in carcinomas of the cardiac region than in those of the distal parts of the stomach. These findings are consistent with results published in the literature: cell proliferation rate alone is not an independent prognostic factor, but the degree of cell proliferation activity and p53 expression are changing usually parallel with each other and with other prognostic markers as well. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of p53 activity and cell proliferation rate in gastric carcinoma is of prognostic value especially if evaluated together with other clinical and histopathological characteristics. The examination of these markers is useful in detecting early gastric cancer, in selecting high-risk patients and in planning proper individual treatment.",2004,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:55,,,,55,51,,Hepatogastroenterology.,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 273-6 Place: PO BOX 17257, ATHENS GR-10024, GREECE Publisher: H G E Update Medical Publishing S A Web of Science ID: 15011884",,,,immunohistochemistry; prognosis; p53; gastric carcinoma; 1361; proliferation markers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of altered miRNAs in gastric cancer in order to assess the use of miRNAs as novel biomarkers for early detection and prognosis prediction of gastric cancer. Methods: We retrieved published articles from the PubMed online database and obtained different sets of data on miRNAs expression profiling in gastric cancer and highlighted the most frequently dysregulated miRNAs in gastric cancer. We then extracted studies that used quantitative RT-PCR and then pooled them together by using meta-disc software (version 1.4). Results: We found that there were 47 aberrantly expressed miRNAs in gastric cancer (29 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated) that were most frequently reported in the literature. In publications that provided information on specific miRNA expression vs. diagnostic value, the pooled data showed good sensitivity and specificity as well as high levels of overall accuracy. However, specimen types could be a factor that introduces substantial heterogeneity. Published studies also showed association of altered miRNA expression with clinicopathological data from gastric cancer patients. Conclusion: Thus, various miRNAs are differentially expressed in gastric cancer and some of them could be further evaluated as biomarkers for early diagnosis of gastric cancer and prediction of prognosis or treatment response.

Methods: Investigating a French national database of inpatient admissions between 2010 and 2018, we identified 12,748 patients with PAD and 38,244 control non-exposed individuals. We performed multiple exposed-non-exposed studies using conditional logistic regression. Results: In comparison with non-exposed patients, PAD patients had increased risk of in situ gastric carcinoma (Odds Ratio (OR) = 10.5 [95 % CI 2.2; 50.5]), malignant gastric tumor (OR = 3.2 [95 % CI 2.2; 4.4]) and colorectal cancer (OR = 1.2 [95 % CI 1; 1.5]). PAD patients had also increased risk of pernicious anaemia (OR = 8 |95 % CI 5.6; 11.5]), Crohn's disease (OR = 4.4 [95 % CI 3.5; 5.6]), ulcerative colitis (OR = 2.9 [95 % CI 2.4; 3.6]) and coeliac disease (OR = 13.3 [95 % CI 9.1; 19.5]). Within patients with gastric cancer, those with PAD had increased risk of pernicious anaemia (OR = 8.4 [95 % CI 1.5; 215]; p = 0.01) but not of H. pylori infection. Conclusions: Risk of gastric cancer is particularly high in PAD patients and notably risk of in situ gastric carcinoma in association with pernicious anaemia. It supports indication of early endoscopic screening in these patients.

We evaluated the usefulness of a novel serum marker, REG4, as compared to that of CA19-9, CEA, and pepsinogen. METHODOLOGY: Pre-therapeutic sera were collected from 74 patients with gastric cancer and 106 healthy controls without any cancers. REG4, CEA, CA19-9, and pepsinogen serum levels were measured in each group. The cut-off value of REG4 was defined, and then the usefulness of REG4 was evaluated with a validation study that included sera collected from 37 patients with gastric cancer and 44 healthy controls without any cancers. RESULTS: REG4 levels were significantly higher in early gastric cancer patients (median 8.42 ng/ml) than in controls (median 5.01 ng/ml) (p < 0.001), and in advanced gastric cancer patients (median 13.12 ng/ml) than in early gastric cancer patients (p < 0.02). A cut-off value of 6.67 ng/ml was defined using the receiver operating characteristics curve. The sensitivity for gastric cancer was 73.0%, the specificity was 70.8%, and the accuracy was 71.8%. Diagnostic accuracy of REG4 was superior to that of the other tests. In the validation study, the sensitivity for gastric cancer was 94.5%, the specificity was 31.8%, and the accuracy was 60.5%.

While gastric cancer prevalence varies globally and incidence rates are decreasing in the West, many cases continue to be diagnosed at an advanced stage and the 5-year survival rate still falls below 30%. Early treatment of gastric cancer by endoscopic and/or surgical therapy may decrease mortality; yet reliable, universally applicable biomarkers for early detection of gastric cancer have still not been established. Materials and Methods: The present work compares the expression of CD133 (prominin-1), a potential biomarker of disease progression in gastric cancer, between independent cohorts of H. pylori (+) and H. pylon (-) patients at each respective stage of carcinogenesis. H. pylori (-) patients (N=45) who underwent gastric biopsy at the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) in Tampa, Florida, and H. pylon (+) patients (N=59) who underwent gastric biopsy at the Instituto de Patologia Mejia Jimenez (IPMJ) in Cali, Colombia were evaluated and immunostained for CD133. Results: A statistically significant increase in CD133 expression (in terms of the Allred score) was observed between all stages of progression (normal mucosa, inflammation/metaplasia, low-grade dysplasia and gastric adenocarcinoma) for each respective patient cohort. No statistically significant difference in CD133 expression at each respective stage of disease was observed between the H. pylori-positive and negative- cohorts. Conclusion: The observation of distinct stepwise increases in CD133 expression in both patient cohorts, and the lack of any significant difference between groups, suggests that CD133 expression may serve as a biomarker for early detection of gastric cancer independent of bacterial status and strain, and corresponding differences in disease histomorphology and classification.

Exosomal miRNAs are promising tumor biomarkers. This research explored the diagnostic value of serum exosomal miRNAs by analyzing the exosomal miRNAs derived from the serum of gastric cancer patients. Methods. Deep sequencing of exosomal miRNAs was performed using an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer on serum samples from three healthy subjects in the normal control group (group N) and six gastric cancer patients in the gastric cancer treatment group (group T). Bioinformatics analysis was performed on exosomal miRNA profiles to screen differentially expressed miRNA. In addition, target gene prediction, GO, and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Finally, the serum exocrine bodies of 24 patients with gastric cancer and 24 normal controls were verified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to confirm the findings. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the subjects was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results. The exosomes were successfully extracted from the serum of gastric cancer patients, which showed a form of goblet vesicles or irregular circles, with an average particle size of approximately 102.3 nm. The exosomal marker proteins, CD9, CD63, TSG101, and calnexin, were positively expressed. Small RNA sequencing detected 15 different types of RNA components in the serum exosomes, and the most abundant one was miRNA. In the screened cohort, the downregulation of seven existing miRNAs and the upregulation of one existing miRNA were observed. Four of them were selected for confirmation, revealing that the expression of miR-10401-3p, miR-1255b-5p, and miR-6736-5p declined significantly in group T (P < 0.05). In addition, the ROC curve showed that the AUC values for these three miRNAs were 0.8333, 0.8316, and 0.8142, respectively; all of them are statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions. The above three miRNAs found in the serum exosomes from gastric cancer patients might serve as diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer.",2022/5/4,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,5346563,,5346563,2022,,J.

There is a high demand for noninvasive screening tools for gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) detection, and GIC-specific markers are required for such purposes. It is established that induction of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) coupled with telomerase activation is essential for cancer development/progression and aberrant TERT promoter methylation of specific 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpGs) has been linked to TERT induction in oncogenesis. Here we analyzed TERT promoter methylation in fecal samples from GIC patients and healthy adults and determined its value as a stool biomarker for GIC detection. Materials and Methods. Sixty-nine GIC patients (34 colorectal carcinoma and 35 gastric cancer) and 62 healthy adults were recruited and fecal samples were collected. Paired tumors and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 34 patients and normal mucosa tissues from 12 healthy individuals were collected. TERT promoter methylation density was determined using pyrosequencing. Results. We identified two GIC-specific methylation sites at 2218 (CpG site 1) and 2210 (CpG site 2) in the TERT promoter in tumor tissues. Methylated TERT promoter CpG sites 1 and 2 were also detectable in patient stool, while only background levels were observed in healthy individuals. The overall sensitivity reached 52.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.3-56.0) for fecal methylated TERT promoter assays at 90% specificity, which was comparable to other known stool methylation markers for GIC detection. The combined assays of fecal TERT promoter methylation and occult blood (OB) significantly improved sensitivity and specificity in colorectal cancer (area under curves for methylation alone: 0.798, 95% CI: 0.707-0.889 vs. methylation+OB: 0.920, 95% CI: 0.859-0.981; p = .028), but not in gastric cancer. Conclusion. This proof-of-concept study suggests the feasibility of stool TERT promoter methylation analyses as an additional tool in noninvasive GIC screening.",Oct-17,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:09,,1178-1188,,10,22,,Oncologist,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 11 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000412687000008,,,,DNA METHYLATION; COLORECTAL-CANCER; GASTRIC-CANCER; Gastrointestinal cancer; MESSENGER-RNA; BLADDER-CANCER; Cancer biomarkers; CATALYTIC SUBUNIT; HTERT PROMOTER; Noninvasive assay; Promoter methylation; Telomerase reverse transcriptase; TELOMERASE REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; TRACT UROTHELIAL CARCINOMAS; URINARY BIOMARKERS; 815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNF180 is a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell development, proliferation, and apoptosis. Methylation of RNF180 (mRNF180) leads to low expression of RNF180, which is closely related to the occurrence and development of gastric cancer (GC). This study was designed to evaluate the potential performance of plasma mRNF180 as noninvasive biomarker for the diagnosis of GC. Methods. A total of 156 participants, including 60 patients with GC, 39 with chronic superficial gastritis (CSG), 27 with chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), and 30 with gastric ulcer (GU) were recruited for this study. Plasma mRNF180 level was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. As a diagnostic target, mRNF180 had a sensitivity of 71.67% (95% CI: 58.36%-82.18%) and specificity of 59.38% (95% CI: 48.85%-69.14%). The area under the ROC curve value of mRNF180 was 0.731 (95% CI: 0.648%-0.813%) for differentiation of GC from benign gastric diseases (BGD). The effectiveness of mRNF180 was superior to that of CEA, CA199, and CA724. mRNF180 was positively correlated with age, tumor size, T stage, N stage, M stage, and clinical stage of patients with GC. Conclusions. Plasma mRNF180 might serve as a useful and noninvasive biomarker for the diagnosis of GC and can be used to evaluate its prognosis.",2022/10/5,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:55,,6548945,,1,2022,,Biomed Res.

Regular screening for gastric cancer (GC) is based on invasive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and is limited to few high-incidence countries. AsGCis a major cause of cancer death worldwide, a non-invasive, simple screening test is of value. We assessed the prevalence of preclinical GC and the corresponding numbers needed to screen (NNS) to detect GC cases both without and with preselection using breath tests from the literature in various populations. Methods. Using age-and sex-specific GC incidence data and rates of transition from preclinical to clinical GC, we estimated the prevalences of preclinical GC world wide in populations aged 50-74 years, and we evaluated the accuracy of breath testing for GC detection based on published studies. We then derived the expected positive predictive values for breath testing in populations with different preclinical GC prevalences. Results. Four studies reporting the sensitivity and specificity of breath tests were identified, and summary estimates of 83% sensitivity and 91% specificity were derived by meta-analysis. The estimates of the overall prevalence of preclinical GC were < 0.5% in men and < 0.2% in women aged 50-74 years across different regions of the world. The positive predictive values, the prevalence among breath test positive people, were approximately nine-fold higher in all populations, resulting in an approximately nine-fold lower NNS to detect one GC case when breath tests were used for preselection for screening. Conclusion. Given the low prevalence of preclinical GC, non-invasive breath tests show promise for making screening more efficient. Further validation of breath tests and evidence on the rates of transition from preclinical to clinical GC are needed to validate the breath test approach.",Jul-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:07,,36009,,3,12,,J.

However, there is no current information on the systematic screening of serum-derived cisplatin resistance biomarkers in gastric cancer (GC). Methods. Cisplatin-resistant GC cell lines were screened for dysregulated miRNAs using small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) and miRNAs were functionally annotated using bioinformatics analyses. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to validate the miRNA-relative transcription levels in GC cells and in 74 GC patients. We analyzed the associations between the clinical characteristics of the patients and their miRNA expression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value for serum-derived cisplatin resistance. Results. Seven miRNAs were identified from 35 differentially expressed miRNAs between the MGC803/DDP and MGC803 cells in a public database. We found four miRNA candidates (miR-9-3p, miR-9-5p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-433-3p) that were significantly associated with chemotherapy responses in GC cells and patients. miR-9-5p (AUC = 0.856, 95% CI [0.773-0.939], p < 0.0001) and a combined group (miR-9-5p + miR-9-3p + miR-433-3p) (AUC = 0.915, 95% CI [0.856-0.975], P < 0.0001) distinguished chemoresistant GC patients from chemosensitive GC patients. Conclusions.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been applied to cancer diagnosis taking into account their role in tumorigenesis. The main purpose of our study was to confirm the possibility of using miRNAs as noninvasive biomarkers for stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) diagnosis. Methods. A total of 246 participants (130 STAD patients and 116 healthy controls (HCs)) were enrolled in this 3-phase study. Five STAD pools and 3 HC pools (with 4 participants in each pool) were used for the screening of the 28 miRNAs using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The training phase (30 STAD patients vs. 24 HCs) and validation phase (80 STAD patients vs. 80 HCs) were used to further verify the identity of these miRNAs. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and bioinformatics analysis were also used. Results. The expression levels of miR-125b-5p and miR-196a-5p were upregulated in STAD serum, compared with the HCs, while miR-1-3p and miR-149-5p showed the opposite result.

Mass screening for gastric cancer (GC), particularly using endoscopy, may not be the most practical approach as a result of its high cost, lack of acceptance, and poor availability. Thus, novel markers that can be used in cost-effective diagnosis and noninvasive screening for GC are needed. Methods. A total of 154 urine samples from GC patients and healthy individuals and 30 pairs of matched tumor and normal stomach tissues were collected. Multivariate analysis was performed on urinary and tissue metabolic profiles acquired using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance and 1 H high-resolution magic angle spinning spectroscopy, respectively. In addition, metabolic profiling of urine from GC patients after curative surgery was performed. Results. Multivariate statistical analysis showed significant separation in the urinary and tissue data of GC patients and healthy individuals. The metabolites altered in the urine of GC patients were related to amino acid and lipid metabolism, consistent with changes in GC tissue. In the external validation, the presence of GC (early or advanced) from the urine model was predicted with high accuracy, which showed much higher sensitivity than carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen. Furthermore, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, alanine, phenylacetylglycine, mannitol, glycolate, and arginine levels were significantly correlated with cancer T stage and, together with hypoxanthine level, showed a recovery tendency toward healthy controls in the postoperative samples compared to the preoperative samples.

Gastric cancers in young adults are thought to be associated with risk factors that include Helicobacter pylori infection and genetic polymorphism. The objective of this study was to elucidate the roles of these risk factors in patients younger than 40 years by analyzing clinicopathological data and H. pylori infection, and using molecular epidemiologic techniques. Methods. Clinicopathological features, the presence of H. pylori infection, endoscopic characteristics of gastritis, genetic polymorphism of P4502E1 ( CYP2E1), and family history of cancer in patients with gastric cancer treated surgically at Nippon Medical School Hospital from 1991 to 2004 were analyzed, based on our medical database. Results. Gastric cancer in those younger than 40 years was characterized by a predominance of female patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma who had undergone total gastrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy. H. pylori infection had a higher prevalence in patients with gastric cancer than in patients with normal endoscopic results or chronic gastritis, especially in those younger than 40 years ( odds ratio, 13.7). Atrophic gastritis, nodular gastritis, and rugal hyperplastic gastritis were observed by endoscopy as H. pyloriassociated gastritis. No difference in the incidence of either CYP2E1 genetic polymorphism or a family history of cancer was observed among different age groups. Conclusion. Gastric cancer in patients younger than 40 years is closely associated with H. pylori infection, but not with genetic characteristics.

Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, partially due to the lack of effective screening strategies. Thus, there is a stringent need for non-invasive biomarkers to improve patient diagnostic efficiency in GC. Methods. This study initially filtered messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as prospective biomarkers through bioinformatics analysis. Clinical validation was conducted using circulating mRNA in plasma from patients with GC. Relationships between expression levels of target genes and clinicopathological characteristics were calculated. Then, associations of these selected biomarkers with overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier plotter online tool. Results. Based on a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional expression profiles across 5 microarrays, top 3 over- and underexpressed mRNAs in GC were generated. Compared with normal controls, expression levels of collagen type VI alpha 3 chain (COL6A3), serpin family H member 1 (SERPINH1) and pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G1 (PLEKHG1) were significantly upregulated in GC plasmas. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves on the diagnostic efficacy of plasma COL6A3, SERPINH1 and PLEKHG1 mRNAs in GC showed that the area under the ROC (AUC) was 0.720, 0.698 and 0.833, respectively. Combined, these three biomarkers showed an elevated AUC of 0.907. Interestingly, the higher COL6A3 level was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in GC patients. High level of SERPINH1 mRNA expression was correlated with advanced age, poor differentiation, lower OS, and PLEKHG1 was also associated with poor OS in GC patients. Conclusion.

Gastric cancer (GC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and thus patients have a poor prognosis. This implies that early detection of this cancer will improve patient prognosis and survival. This systematic review explored the association of circulating protein and metabolite biomarkers with GC development.Methods. A literature search was conducted until November 2021 on Medline, Em -base, Cochrane library, and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they assessed circulating proteins and metabolites in blood, urine, or saliva and determined their association with GC risk. Quality of identified studies was determined using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Random and fixed effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled odds ratio.Results. A total of 53 studies were included. High levels of anti-Helicobacter pylORi IgG levels, pepsinogen I (PGI) <30 mu g/L and serum pepsinogen I/ pepsinogen II (PGI/II) ratio<3 were positively associated with risk of developing GC (pooled odds ratio (OR): 2.70; 95% CI: 1.44-5.04, 5.96, 95% CI: 2.65-13.42 and 4.43; 95% CI: 3.04-6.47). In addition, an inverse relationship was found between ferritin, iron and transferrin levels and risk of developing GC (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.38-1,0.97; 95% CI: 0.94-1 and 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76-0.94). However, there was no association between levels of glucose, cholesterol, vitamin C, vitamin B12, vitamin A, alpha-Carotene, beta-Carotene, alpha-Tocopherol, gamma-Tocopherol, and GC risk.Conclusion. The pooled analysis demonstrated that high levels of anti-Helicobacter pylORi IgG, PGI <30 mu g/L and serum PGI/II ratio <3 and low levels of ferritin, iron and transferrin were associated with risk of GC.

Methods Among urine samples from 372 patients, age- and sex-matched 282 patients were randomly divided into three groups: 18 patients in a discovery cohort; 176 patients in a training cohort and 88 patients in a validation cohort. Results Among urinary proteins identified in the comprehensive quantitative proteomics analysis, urinary levels of TFF1 (uTFF1) and ADAM12 (uADAM12) were significantly independent diagnostic biomarkers for GC, in addition toHelicobacter pyloristatus. A urinary biomarker panel combining uTFF1, uADAM12 andH. pylorisignificantly distinguished between HC and GC patients in both training and validation cohorts. On the analysis for sex-specific biomarkers, this combination panel demonstrated a good AUC of 0.858 for male GC, whereas another combination panel of uTFF1, uBARD1 andH. pylorialso provided a good AUC of 0.893 for female GC.

In this study, we further explored the microRNA (miRNA) regulatory mechanism between Bmi-1 and RKIP. Methods Microarray analysis was first carried out to identify miRNA profiles that were differentially expressed in cells overexpressing Bmi-1. Then, miRNAs that could regulate RKIP were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were performed to measure the expression of Bmi-1, miR-155, miR-27a and RKIP. RKIP was confirmed as a target of miR-27a and miR-155 through luciferase reporter assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The effects of the Bmi-1/miR-27a/RKIP and Bmi-1/miR-155/RKIP axes on tumor growth, proliferation, migration, invasion, colony-formation ability, metastasis and chemoresistance were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Results The downregulation of RKIP by Bmi-1 occurred at the protein but not mRNA level. This indicates probable posttranscriptional regulation. miRNA expression profiles of cells with ectopic expression of Bmi-1 were analyzed and compared to those of control cells by microarray analysis. A total of 51 upregulated and 72 downregulated miRNAs were identified. Based on publicly available algorithms, miR-27a and miR-155 were predicted, selected and demonstrated to target RKIP. Bmi-1, miR-27a and miR-155 are elevated in human GC and associated with poor prognosis of GC, while RKIP is expressed at lower levels in GC and correlated with good prognosis. Then, in vitro tests shown that in addition to regulating RKIP expression via miR-27a and miR-155, Bmi-1 was also able to regulate the migration, invasion, proliferation, colony-formation ability and chemosensitivity of GC cells through the same pathway. Finally, the in vivo test showed similar results, whereby the knockdown of the Bmi-1 gene led to the inhibition of tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance through miR-27a and miR-155. Conclusions Bmi-1 was proven to induce the expression of miR-27a and miR-155 and thus promote tumor metastasis and chemoresistance by targeting RKIP in GC. Overall, miR-27a and miR-155 might be promising targets for the screening, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and disease monitoring of GC.",2020/6/24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:02,,109,,1,19,,Mol.

A prognostic nomogram was constructed to predict and identity susceptible population of UGPL before endoscope screening. Methods We recruited 300 ,016 eligible participants for upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGC) screening aged 40-74 years from two cities in Hunan province from 2012 to 2019. Individuals at high risk of UGC on basis of questionnaire estimation underwent endoscopic screening. Participants in two cities accepting endoscopy were used as training and external validation cohorts, respectively. A nomogram was developed based on independent prognostic factors of UGPL determined in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Of 35, 621 with high risk for UGC, 10, 364 subjects undertook endoscopy (participation rate of 29.1%). The detection rate for UGPL was 4.55%. The nomogram showed that age, gender, mental trama, picked food, and atrophic gastritis history in a descending order were significant contributors to UGPL risk. The C-index value of internal and external validation of the model is 0.612 and 0.670, respectively. The calibration data for UGPL showed optimal agreement between the nomogram prediction and actual observation. Furthermore, high-risk and low-risk group divided based on score from the nomogram predicted a significantly distinct detection rate.

The aim of this study is to analyze the natural history of gastric cancer. Patients and Methods We included patients with gastric cancer who had not received any treatment and were staged using endoscopy/endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography on at least two follow-up visits during intervals of nontreatment. Tumor volumes were also measured in addition to the staging. Survival of each stage at diagnosis was also analyzed. Results A total of 101 patients were included. The mean follow-up period was 35.1 +/- 34.4 months. The gastric cancer doubling time was 11.8 months for T1 and 6.2 months for T4. The progression time from early gastric cancer to advanced gastric cancer was 34 months. It decreased as the stages advanced: from 34 months between tumor-nodes-metastasis stage I and II to 1.8 months between stage III and IV. No variable was identified as a risk factor for cancer progression. The 5-year survival rates of untreated patients were 46.2% in stage I and 0% in stage II, stage III, and stage IV.

Methods Patients with early gastric cancer who underwent endoscopic treatment between April 2021 and July 2022 were enrolled. All cases underwent white light imaging and linked color imaging. Three experts evaluated lesion visibility using a visual analog scale. A mean score >= 3 on white light imaging was defined as ""good visibility"", and <3 as ""poor visibility"". We extracted patient information and endoscopic and pathological data for the lesion and background mucosa, analyzed factors associated with the visibility of early gastric cancer, and compared visibility between white light imaging and linked color imaging. Results Ninety-seven lesions were analyzed, with good visibility in 49 and poor visibility in 48. Multivariate analysis revealed small lesion size (odds ratio 1.89) and presence of endoscopic intestinal metaplasia (odds ratio 0.49) as significantly associated with the poor visibility of early gastric cancer. Mean visibility score was significantly higher for linked color imaging (P<0.001). Mean score for linked color imaging was significantly higher in the poor visibility group (P<0.001), but not significantly different in the good visibility group (P = 0.292).

X-ray examination can evaluate the condition of the stomach, and it can be used for gastric cancer mass screening. However, skilled doctors for interpretation of X-ray examination are decreasing due to the diverse of inspections. AIM To evaluate the effectiveness of stomach regions that are automatically estimated by a deep learning-based model for CAG detection. METHODS We used 815 gastric X-ray images (GXIs) obtained from 815 subjects. The ground truth of this study was the diagnostic results in X-ray and endoscopic examinations. For a part of GXIs for training, the stomach regions are manually annotated. A model for automatic estimation of the stomach regions is trained with the GXIs. For the rest of them, the stomach regions are automatically estimated. Finally, a model for automatic CAG detection is trained with all GXIs for training. RESULTS In the case that the stomach regions were manually annotated for only 10 GXIs and 30 GXIs, the harmonic mean of sensitivity and specificity of CAG detection were 0.955 +/- 0.002 and 0.963 +/- 0.004, respectively.

The increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection to treat early gastric cancer is a concern because regional lymph nodes are not addressed. The aim of the study was thus to critically evaluate current evidence with regard to tumour-specific factors associated with lymph node metastases in ""early gastric cancer"" to develop a more precise definition and improve clinical management. Methods A systematic and comprehensive search of major reference databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library) was undertaken using a combination of text words ""early gastric cancer"", ""lymph node metastasis"", ""factors"", ""endoscopy"", ""surgery"", ""lymphadenectomy"" ""mucosa"", ""submucosa"", ""lymphovascular invasion"", ""differentiated"", ""undifferentiated"" and ""ulcer"". All available publications that described tumour-related factors associated with lymph node metastases in early gastric cancer were included. Results The initial search yielded 1494 studies, of which 42 studies were included in the final analysis. Over time, the definition of early gastric cancer has broadened and the indications for endoscopic treatment have widened. The mean frequency of lymph node metastases increased on the basis of depth of infiltration (mucosa 6 % vs. submucosa 28 %), presence of lymphovascular invasion (absence 9 % vs. presence 53 %), tumour differentiation (differentiated 13 % vs. undifferentiated 34 %) and macroscopic type (elevated 13 % vs. flat 26 %) and tumour diameter (<= 2 cm 8 % vs. >2 cm 25 %).

Methods Totally 82 patients with GC, 30 with chronic nonatrophic gastritis and 30 with chronic atrophic gastritis were included in this study. Four of the 82 GC patients were selected for screening. Total RNA from malignant and adjacent tissue samples was extracted, and circRNAs in four patients were screened. According to the screening results, the eight most upregulated and downregulated circRNAs with a statistically significant association with GC were identified by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then, the most regulated circRNA was selected for further sensitivity and specificity assessments. CircRNA expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in 78 GC (21 and 57 early and advanced GC, respectively) and adjacent tissue samples, as well as in gastric fluid samples from 30 patients with chronic nonatrophic gastritis, 30 with chronic atrophic gastritis, and 78 GC. Results A total of 445 circRNAs, including 69 upregulated and 376 downregulated circRNAs, showed significantly altered expression in GC tissue samples. Hsa_circ_000780 was significantly downregulated in 80.77% of GC tissue samples, with levels in GC tissue samples correlating with tumor size, tumor stage, T stage, venous invasion, carcinoembryonic antigen amounts, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Strikingly, this circRNA was found in the gastric fluid of patients with early and advanced GC. Conclusions The present study uncovered a new circRNA expression profile in human GC, with hsa_circ_000780 significantly downregulated in GC tissue and gastric fluid specimens. These findings indicate that hsa_circ_000780 should be considered a novel biomarker for early GC screening.",2021/11/27,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:57,,282,,1,14,,BMC Med.

Objectives To determine the role of endoscopic ulcer as a predictor of clinical behaviors in EGC. Methods Data of 3,270 patients with EGC who underwent surgery between January 2005 and December 2012 were reviewed. Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed in relation to the presence and stage of ulcer in EGC. Based on endoscopic findings, the stage of ulcer was categorized as active, healing, or scar. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze factors associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM). Results 2,343 (71.7%) patients had endoscopic findings of ulceration in EGC. Submucosal (SM) invasion, LNM, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion, and undifferentiated-type histology were significantly higher in ulcerative than non-ulcerative EGC. Comparison across different stages of ulcer revealed that SM invasion, LNM, and LVI were significantly associated with the active stage, and that these features exhibited significant stage-based differences, being most common at the active stage, and least common at the scar stage. The presence of endoscopic ulcer and active status of the ulcer were identified as independent risk factors for LNM. Conclusions Ulcerative EGC detected by endoscopy exhibited more aggressive behaviors than nonulcerative EGC. Additionally, the endoscopic stage of ulcer may predict the clinicopathological behaviors of EGC.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori, erosive esophagitis, peptic ulcer, and precancerous lesions such as atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, gastric dysplasia, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy in asymptomatic Chinese. Methods From January to December 2017, a questionnaire was administered to consecutive asymptomatic patients undergoing routine physical examination, which included their first screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy. H. pylori infection was determined by one of positive C-13 urea breath tests or rapid urease test and histology. The presence of H. pylori infection, erosive esophagitis, peptic ulcer, precancerous gastric histology, and upper GI malignancy was analyzed in relation to demographic factors. Results A total of 1108 subjects (mean age: 48, range 21 to 79, 39.5% men) were included. The findings were: erosive esophagitis 7.8%, active H. pylori infection 44%, peptic ulcer 9.1% (duodenal 5.8%, gastric 2.5% or both 0.8%); 0.5% had gastric cancer. Male, smoking history, and current H. pylori infection were all significantly related to the presence of peptic ulcer. Totally, 1095 patients had gastric histopathology and premalignant gastric lesions were present in 67.4%; atrophic gastritis (67.4%), intestinal metaplasia (27.4%), and gastric dysplasia (0.5%). Age, current and previous H. pylori infection were risk factors significantly associated with precancerous lesions.

The present study aimed to investigate the expression, function and mechanism of action of GKN2 in gastric cancer. Methods Molecular biology assays were performed to elucidate the function and underlying mechanisms of GKN2 in gastric cancer under stress-induced condition in vivo and in vitro. Clinical specimens were used to assess the correlation of GKN2 and prognosis. Results We found that overexpression of GKN2 significantly enhanced apoptosis and growth arrest in vitro. GKN2 expression increased in gastric cancer cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide and promoted reactive oxygen species-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and resulted in increased cell apoptosis via inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling pathway and activation of JNK signaling pathway through the direct interaction of GKN2 with Hsc70. Trefoil factor 1 might contribute to the tumor suppressing effects of GKN2. MiR-216a downregulated GKN2 expression. GKN2 also inhibited xenograft tumor growth and was an independent and significant prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer treated with oxaliplatin. Conclusions Taken together, our data indicate that GKN2 may increase sensitivity of GC cells to the drugs which increase ROS levels in tumors. Inhibition of the interaction between GKN2 and Hsc70 could attenuate the effects induced by GKN2. GKN2 overexpression could be used to determine the subgroup of patients to obtain the more favorable outcome of oxaliplatin treatment and may be used as biomarker of the prognosis of this cancer.",2019/8/5,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:05,,338,,1,38,,J.

This study aimed to clarify the effect of H. pylori eradication therapy on mixed-histological-type early gastric cancer using endoscopic and histological findings.Methods This single-center, retrospective study included patients with mixed-histological-type gastric cancer who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection at the Cancer Institute Hospital. We compared detailed magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging findings between eradicated and non-eradicated groups of patients with differentiated-type- and undifferentiated-type-predominant cancers. Subsequently, we performed histological evaluations of the non-cancerous epithelium covering differentiated-type components.Results A total of 124 patients with mixed-type early gastric cancer were enrolled (eradicated group: 62 differentiated-type-predominant cancer patients and 8 undifferentiated-type-predominant cancer patients; non-eradication group: 40 differentiated-type-predominant cancer patients and 14 undifferentiated-type-predominant cancer patients). Regarding differentiated-type-predominant cancer, differentiated-type findings were detected in all patients in eradicated and non-eradicated groups. The difference in the detection rate of undifferentiated-type findings between both groups was not significant in differentiated-type-predominant cancer patients. In differentiated-type-predominant cancers, the percentage of non-cancerous epithelium covering differentiated-type components was higher in the eradicated group than in the non-eradicated group (median: 60% vs. 40%, p < 0.001).Conclusions Although the pathological findings of differentiated-type-predominant cancer were affected by H. pylori eradication, eradication did not affect the diagnosis of differentiated-type-predominant early gastric cancer using magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging.

Consequently, strengthening the screening of patients with EGC and precancerous lesions (PCLs) is essential. AIM To identify the value of serum pepsinogen ratio (PGR) screening for EGC and PCLs in the Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital. METHODS We first selected 385 patients with gastric lesions in the Youcheng area, determining benign lesions, PCLs, and EGC in 135, 123, and 127 cases, respectively, based on endoscopy and case diagnosis. The positive rates of pepsinogen I, pepsinogen II and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the three groups were detected, and the PGR was calculated. Subsequently, we plotted receiver operating characteristic curves to analyze the screening value of PGR and H. pylori-positive rates for PCLs and EGC. RESULTS PGR expression demonstrated a decreasing trend in patients with benign lesions, PCLs, and EGC successively according to the detection results, whereas the H. pylori-positive rate was notably increased in patients with PCLs and EGC compared to those with benign lesions. The area under the curves (AUCs) of PGR, H. pylori, and their combination in differentiating patients with benign lesions from those with PCLs were 0.611, 0.582, and 0.689, respectively; PGR, H. pylori, and their combination had an AUC of 0.618, 0.502, and 0.618 in distinguishing PCL patients from EGC patients, respectively; the AUCs of PGR, H. pylori, and their combination in discriminating patients with benign lesions from those with EGC were 0.708, 0.581, and 0.750, respectively. CONCLUSION PGR has great screening potential for patients with EGC and PCLs in the Youcheng area, and the screening efficiency is further improved by combining the H. pylori-positive rate.",2024/12/27,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/24 16:31,,,,12,16,,World J.

Objective A case-control study was designed to evaluate the clinical and endoscopic characteristics of patients with nonampullary duodenal epithelial tumours (NADETs). Methods Patients with NADETs were chronologically divided into a discovery and a validation sets. Two age- and sex-matched control individuals for each case in the discovery set were randomly selected from individuals without NADET. A prediction model for the presence of NADET, constructed in the discovery set, was evaluated in the validation set. Results In total, 368 adenomas, 81 adenocarcinomas, and 314 controls were analysed. Current smoking, Barrett oesophagus, fundic gland polyps, history of malignant disease, and absence of dyslipidaemia were independently associated with the presence of NADET. The combination of these five factors enabled significant discrimination for NADET in the bulb with a sensitivity of 0.81 in the validation set. We also showed that duodenal adenocarcinomas in the bulb had greater invasive potential than adenocarcinomas in the second portion. Conclusion The presence of a duodenal tumour in the bulb could be predicted by clinical and endoscopic findings, which helps improve the prognosis and quality of life of patients.",Mar-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,250-260,,2,7,,United European Gastroenterol.

Here, we investigate miR-30a expression in gastric lesions and identify its novel target gene which is associated with the intestinal-type GC. Methods We conducted in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR to determine miR-30a expression in gastric tissues. miR-30a functions were determined through induction or inhibition of miR-30a in GC cell lines. A gene microarray was utilized to confirm miR-30a target genes in GC, and siRNA-mediated target gene suppression and immunostaining were performed. The Cancer Genome Atlas data were utilized to validate gene expressions. Results We found down-regulation of miR-30a during chief cell transdifferentiation into SPEM. MiR-30a level was also reduced in the early stage of GC, and its level was maintained in advanced GC. We identified a novel target gene of miR-30a and ITGA2, and our results showed that either ectopic expression of miR-30a or ITGA2 knockdown suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration, and tumorigenesis. Levels of ITGA2 inversely correlated with levels of miR-30a in human intestinal-type GC. Conclusion We found down-regulation of miR-30a in preneoplastic lesions and its tumor-suppressive functions by targeting ITGA2 in GC. The level of ITGA2, which functions as an oncogene, was up-regulated in human GC. The results of this study suggest that coordination of the miR-30a-ITGA2 axis may serve as an important mechanism in the development of gastric precancerous lesions and intestinal-type GC.",Jul-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:03,,600-613,,4,23,,Gastric Cancer,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 14 Place: New York Publisher: Springer Web of Science ID: WOS:000517022900001,,,,Gastric cancer; Metaplasia; COLORECTAL-CANCER; INVASION; GROWTH; PROMOTES; Tumor suppressor; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; CANCER CELLS; DECREASES MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; ITGA2; miR-30a; MIR-30A; POLYPEPTIDE-EXPRESSING METAPLASIA; TO-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; 605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether an interaction exists among recognized variables is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify the combinatorial characteristics of group with high overestimation rate to determine which group should be considered carefully for EUS-based treatment plans. Methods We retrospectively analyzed early gastric cancer patients who underwent EUS from 2005 to 2016. The accuracy of EUS T stage and factors affecting over-/underestimation were examined by using decision tree analysis, the CHAID method. Results The most significant factor affecting the accuracy of the EUS T stage was the size. The rate of overestimation was higher in lesions > 3 cm (37.2% vs. 28.8% vs. 17.1%, p < 0.001). In lesions > 3 cm, the rate of overestimation was higher in lesions with an ulcer (62.1% vs. 35.0%, p < 0.001). Moreover, for lesions <= 3 cm, the accuracy of the EUS T stage was more affected by differentiation and location. The rate of overestimation was higher in undifferentiated-type lesions <= 2 cm (24.5% vs. 13.9%, p < 0.001) and 2-3 cm (33.3% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.011). In the differentiated type, the location affected the accuracy of the EUS T stage.

Aim To review systematically the presenting features of oesophagogastric cancers in primary care, including open-access endoscopy clinics. Design and setting Systematic review and meta-analysis. Method MEDLINE (R), Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched for studies of adults who were symptomatic and presented in primary care or open-access endoscopy clinics. Exclusions were being asymptomatic, screening, or recurrent cancers. Data were extracted to estimate the diagnostic performance of features of oesophagogastric cancers and summarised in a meta-analysis. Results Fourteen studies were identified. The strongest summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were for: dyspepsia 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 0.56) and 0.48 (95% CI = 0.31 to 0.65); pain 0.41 (95% CI = 0.24 to 0.62) and 0.75 (95% CI = 0.51 to 0.89); and dysphagia 0.32 (95% CI = 0.17 to 0.52) and 0.92 (95% CI = 0.81 to 0.97).

It is therefore essential to develop cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic tools for gastric cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the presence of certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with gastric cancer and to survey the usefulness of VOCs as screening tools of gastric cancer. Methods The present study was conducted prospectively to identify the relationship between gastric cancer and specific VOCs quantified by mass spectrometry. Exhaled breath samples from a total of 43 participants were analysed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea (KC16TISI0598), and registered to clinical research information service (KCT0004356). Results Nine VOCs differed significantly between the control and cancer patient groups. When participants were divided into control, early gastric cancer (EGC), and advanced gastric cancer (AGC) groups, seven VOCs remained significantly different. Of these, four (propanal, aceticamide, isoprene and 1,3 propanediol) showed gradual increases as cancer advanced, from normal control to EGC to AGC. In receiver operating characteristic curves for these four VOCs, the area under the curve for gastric cancer prediction was highest (0.842) when more than two VOCs were present. Conclusions The present study offers potential directions for non-invasive gastric cancer screening, and may inspire advanced diagnostic technologies in the era of smart home healthcare. However, despite the high accuracy, cancer-specific VOCs from several studies on different populations, and analytic methods show inconsistency, it is necessary to establish standards for each analytical method, and to validate on each population.",2021/4/29,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:59,,560591,,560591,11,,Front.

However, a reliable, practical indicator of the performance of endoscopists in screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy has not yet been identified. Aims We aimed to identify quality indicators of esophagogastroduodenoscopy for the detection of early gastric neoplasms, including gastric dysplasia and early gastric cancer, focusing on the endoscopic findings. Methods The records of 54,889 individuals who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for gastric cancer screening at the Yonsei University Severance Hospital Health Promotion Center, Seoul, Korea, between February 2006 and July 2013 were analyzed. The detection rates for various gastric lesions including early gastric neoplasms were analyzed for each endoscopist. Results Gastric dysplasia, early gastric cancer, and advanced gastric cancer were detected in 97 (0.18 %), 54 (0.10 %), and 21 (0.04 %) of 54,889 individuals, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the detection rates of gastric subepithelial lesions and gastric diverticuli were independent factors associated with the detection rate of early gastric neoplasms (regression coefficients of 0.096 and 0.532, respectively). A quality score formula was deduced using these regression coefficients to predict the ability of an endoscopist to detect early gastric neoplasms. A trend test confirmed that the group of endoscopists with a higher quality score showed a significantly higher rate of early gastric neoplasm detection (P < 0.001). Conclusions The detection rates of gastric subepithelial lesions and gastric diverticuli are well correlated with that of early gastric neoplasms. In addition, the proposed quality scoring system could be a good quality indicator for the detection of early gastric neoplasms.",Jan-15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:15,,38-46,,1,60,,Dig. Dis.

We aimed to synthesize currently available comparative data on gastric cancer mortality in healthy, asymptomatic adults by explicitly classifying the screening effects through study designs and types of intervention effects.Methods We searched multiple databases through October 31, 2022 for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies of any design that compared gastric cancer mortality among radiographic or endoscopic screening and no screening in a community-dwelling adult population were included. The method included a duplicate assessment of eligibility, double extraction of summary data, and validity assessment using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool. Bayesian three-level hierarchical random-effects meta-analysis synthesized data corrected for self-selection bias on the relative risk (RR) for per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-screen (ITS) effects. The study registration number at PROSPERO is CRD42021277126.Findings We included seven studies in which a screening program was newly introduced (median attendance rate, 31%; at moderate-to-critical risk of bias), and seven cohort and eight case-control studies with ongoing screening programs (median attendance rate, 21%; all at critical risk of bias); thus, data of 1,667,117 subjects were included. For the PP effect, the average risk reduction was significant for endoscopy (RR 0.52; 95% credible interval: 0.39-0.79) but nonsignificant for radiography (0.80; 0.60-1.06). The ITS effect was not significant for both radiography (0.98; 0.86-1.09) and endoscopy (0.94; 0.71-1.28). The magnitude of the effects depended on the assumptions for the self-selection bias correction. Restricting the scope to East Asian studies only did not change the results.

However, DD of gastric cancer within the USA and etiology of those delays are not understood. Our study quantifies the proportion of gastric cancer patients experiencing DD and contributing barriers of care. Methods We conducted a single institution retrospective review of 256 gastric cancer patients treated between 2015 and 2020. Patients with an interval from symptom onset to diagnosis of > 90 days were classified as having DD and categorized into one of the following barriers of care: access, provider knowledge/skills, and patient factors. Chi-square tests were used to analyze categorical group differences. Non-pooled t-tests and ANOVA were used to compare differences in group means. Results A total of 59 patients (23%) had DD. Among patients with DD, the mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 229 days vs 30 days in the non-delayed group (p < 0.0001). The most common barrier of care was provider knowledge/skills gaps (44%), followed by access (36%) and patient-related factors (20%). Only 5% of patients who experienced delays reported abdominal pain alone, with the remaining 95% of patients reporting more than one symptom including obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, or weight loss. Conclusion Patients often face lengthy delays in gastric cancer diagnosis which arise from healthcare system factors such as access barriers or gaps in provider knowledge/skills.

Studies in various cancers have reported perturbations in kinases resulting in aberrant phosphorylation of oncoproteins and tumor suppressor proteins. Methods In this study, we carried out quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of gastric cancer tissues and corresponding xenograft samples. Using these data, we employed bioinformatics analysis to identify aberrant signaling pathways. We further performed molecular inhibition and silencing of the upstream regulatory kinase in gastric cancer cell lines and validated its effect on cellular phenotype. Through an ex vivo technology utilizing patient tumor and blood sample, we sought to understand the therapeutic potential of the kinase by recreating the tumor microenvironment. Results Using mass spectrometry-based high-throughput analysis, we identified 1,344 phosphosites and 848 phosphoproteins, including differential phosphorylation of 177 proteins (fold change cut-off >= 1.5). Our data showed that a subset of differentially phosphorylated proteins belonged to splicing machinery. Pathway analysis highlighted Cdc2-like kinase (CLK1) as upstream kinase. Inhibition of CLK1 using TG003 and CLK1 siRNA resulted in a decreased cell viability, proliferation, invasion and migration as well as modulation in the phosphorylation of SRSF2. Ex vivo experiments which utilizes patient's own tumor and blood to recreate the tumor microenvironment validated the use of CLK1 as a potential target for gastric cancer treatment. Conclusions Our data indicates that CLK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of splicing process in gastric cancer and that CLK1 can act as a novel therapeutic target in gastric cancer.",Sep-20,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:03,,796-810,,5,23,,Gastric Cancer,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 15 Place: New York Publisher: Springer Web of Science ID: WOS:000528409100001,,,,Biomarker; KINASE; INHIBITION; PHOSPHORYLATION; MECHANISMS; HEAD; PDX in vivo models; Phosphoserine; SPLICEOSOME; Spliceosome complex; SRPK1; Targeted therapy; threonine; 589,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumors were significantly smaller (1.3 vs. 1.8 cm, P < 0.001), and the incidence of metaplasia was significantly higher (90.4 vs. 65.9 %, P < 0.001) for interval EGC than for initially detected EGC. And no symptoms (50 vs. 17.7 %, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with interval EGC. However, tumor location, differentiation, gross morphology, and Helicobacter pylori infection status did not differ significantly. Conclusions Subtle mucosal lesions with surrounding intestinal metaplasia were associated with interval EGC. Careful endoscopic screening for patients with intestinal metaplasia at short-term interval would be beneficial for decreasing interval EGC rates.",Apr-15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:14,,936-943,,4,60,,Dig.

Hence, we explored the risk factors for MEGC and different types of MEGC, based on the endoscopic resected population. Methods This retrospective, case-control study was conducted at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (NJDTH). We included patients who were diagnosed with EGC during screening EGD, underwent endoscopic resection, and were confirmed by postoperative pathology at the NJDTH from January 2014 to December 2021, and classified them into different types according to the different root causes of misses. Univariable, multivariable, subgroup and propensity score analyses were used to explore the risk factors for MEGC and different types of MEGC. Results A total of 447 patients, comprising 345 with initially detected early gastric cancer (IDEGC) and 102 with MEGC, were included in this study. Larger size (>= 1 cm) (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.74, P = 0.002) and invasion depth of submucosa (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.69, P = 0.007) were negatively associated with MEGC. Use of sedation (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.20-0.52, P < 0.001) and longer observation time (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.96, P = 0.034) exhibited protective effect on MEGC. Conclusions Smaller and more superficial EGC lesions are more susceptible to misdiagnosis.

MiRNAs are deregulated in different tumors including gastric cancer (GC) and have potential diagnostic and prognostic implications. The aim of our study was to determine miRNA profile in GC tissues, followed by evaluation of deregulated miRNAs in plasma of GC patients. Using available databases and bioinformatics methods we also aimed to evaluate potential target genes of confirmed differentially expressed miRNA and validate these findings in GC tissues. Methods The study included 51 GC patients and 51 controls. Initially, we screened miRNA expression profile in 13 tissue samples of GC and 12 normal gastric tissues with TaqMan low density array (TLDA). In the second stage, differentially expressed miRNAs were validated in a replication cohort using qRT-PCR in tissue and plasma samples. Subsequently, we analyzed potential target genes of deregulated miRNAs using bioinformatics approach, determined their expression in GC tissues and performed correlation analysis with targeting miRNAs. Results Profiling with TLDA revealed 15 deregulated miRNAs in GC tissues compared to normal gastric mucosa. Replication analysis confirmed that miR-148a-3p, miR-204-5p, miR-223-3p and miR-375 were consistently deregulated in GC tissues. Analysis of GC patients' plasma samples showed significant down-regulation of miR-148a-3p, miR-375 and up-regulation of miR-223-3p compared to healthy subjects. Further, using bioinformatic tools we identified targets of replicated miRNAs and performed disease-associated gene enrichment analysis. Ultimately, we evaluated potential target gene BCL2 and DNMT3B expression by qRT-PCR in GC tissue, which correlated with targeting miRNA expression. Conclusions Our study revealed miRNA profile in GC tissues and showed that miR-148a-3p, miR-223-3p and miR-375 are deregulated in GC plasma samples, but these circulating miRNAs showed relatively weak diagnostic performance as sole biomarkers. Target gene analysis demonstrated that BCL2 and DNMT3B expression in GC tissue correlated with their targeting miRNA expression.",2015/7/14,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:14,,e0132327,,7,10,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 20 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000358194900042,,,,METASTASIS; EXPRESSION; SIGNATURE; CELL-PROLIFERATION; QUANTIFICATION; NORMALIZATION; PCR DATA; 995,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In view of this clinical challenge, identification of non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis is imperative. Herein, we aimed to develop a non-invasive, liquid-biopsy based assay by using circular RNAs (circRNAs) as molecular biomarkers for early detection of GC. Methods We performed systematic biomarker discovery and validation of the candidate circRNAs in matched tissue specimens of GC and adjacent normal mucosa. Next, we translated the discovered circRNA based biomarker panel into serum samples in a training and validation cohort of GC patients (n = 194) and non-disease controls (n = 94) and evaluated their diagnostic performance. In addition, we measured the expression of circRNAs in serum samples of pre- and post-surgical GC patients and evaluated the specificity of circRNAs biomarker panel with respect to other gastro-intestinal (GI) malignancies. Results We identified 10-circRNAs in the discovery phase with subsequent validation in a pilot cohort of GC tissue specimens. Using a training cohort of patients, we developed an 8-circRNA based risk-prediction model for the diagnosis of GC. We observed that our biomarker panel robustly discriminated GC patients from non-disease controls with an AUC of 0.87 in the training, and AUC of 0.83 in the validation cohort. Notably, the biomarker panel could robustly identify even early-stage GC patients, regardless of their tumor histology (diffuse vs. intestinal). The decreased expression of circRNAs in post-surgery serum specimens indicated their tumor-specificity and their potential source of origin in the systemic circulation. Conclusions We identified a panel of 8-circRNAs as non-invasive, liquid-biopsy biomarkers which might serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for the early detection of GC.",2022/2/9,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,42,,1,21,,Mol.

However, the diagnostic efficacy of non-experts in differentiating early gastric cancer from non-cancerous lesions by M-NBI remained far from satisfactory. In this study, we developed a new system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze gastric mucosal lesions observed by M-NBI. Methods A total of 386 images of non-cancerous lesions and 1702 images of early gastric cancer were collected to train and establish a CNN model (Inception-v3). Then a total of 341 endoscopic images (171 non-cancerous lesions and 170 early gastric cancer) were selected to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of CNN and endoscopists. Primary outcome measures included diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CNN system in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer were 91.18%, 90.64%, and 90.91%, respectively. No significant difference was spotted in the specificity and accuracy of diagnosis between CNN and experts.

Endoscopy is regarded as insufficient for early detection due to the infiltrative phenotype of diffuse-type cancers. Microscopic foci of invasive signet ring cells are pathognomonic of CDH1 and precede development of diffuse gastric cancer. We aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of endoscopy for cancer interception in individuals with germline CDH1 variants, particularly in those who declined prophylactic total gastrectomy. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we included asymptomatic patients aged 2 years or older with pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline CDH1 variants who underwent endoscopic screening and surveillance at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) as part of a natural history study of hereditary gastric cancers (NCT03030404). Endoscopy was done with non-targeted biopsies and one or more targeted biopsy and assessment of focal lesions. Endoscopy findings, pathological data, personal and family cancer history, and demographics were recorded. Procedural morbidity, gastric cancer detection by endoscopy and gastrectomy, and cancer-specific events were assessed. Screening was defined as the initial endoscopy and all subsequent endoscopies were considered surveillance; follow-up endoscopy was at 6 to 12 months. The primary aim was to determine effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance for detection of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma. Findings Between Jan 25, 2017, and Dec 12, 2021, 270 patients (median age 46 center dot 6 years [IQR 36 center dot 5-59 center dot 8], 173 [64%] female participants, 97 [36%] male participants; 250 [93%] were non-Hispanic White, eight [3%] were multiracial, four [2%] were non-Hispanic Black, three [1%] were Hispanic, two [1%] were Asian, and one [<1%] was American Indian or Alaskan Native) with germline CDH1 variants were screened, in whom 467 endoscopies were done as of data cutoff (April 30, 2022). 213 (79%) of 270 patients had a family history of gastric cancer, and 176 (65%) reported a family history of breast cancer. Median follow-up was 31 center dot 1 months (IQR 17 center dot 1-42 center dot 1). 38 803 total gastric biopsy samples were obtained, of which 1163 (3%) were positive for invasive signet ring cell carcinoma. Signet ring cell carcinoma was detected in 76 (63%) of 120 patients who had two or more surveillance endoscopies, of whom 74 had occult cancer detected; the remaining two individuals developed focal ulcerations each corresponding to pT3N0 stage carcinoma. 98 (36%) of 270 patients proceeded to prophylactic total gastrectomy. Among patients who had a prophylactic total gastrectomy after an endoscopy with biopsy samples negative for cancer (42 [43%] of 98), multifocal stage IA gastric carcinoma was detected in 39 (93%). Two (1%) participants died during follow-up, one due to metastatic lobular breast cancer and the other due to underlying cerebrovascular disease, and no participants were diagnosed with advanced stage (III or IV) cancer during follow-up. Interpretation In our cohort, endoscopic cancer surveillance was an acceptable alternative to surgery in individuals with CDH1 variants who declined total gastrectomy. The low rate of incident tumours (>T1a) suggests that surveillance might be a rational alternative to surgery in individuals with CDH1 variants.",Apr-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,383-391,,4,24,,Lancet Oncol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 9 Place: New York Publisher: Elsevier Science Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:000967755600001,,,,CADHERIN GERMLINE MUTATIONS; FAMILIES; 233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and methods We performed this study on patients undergoing screening endoscopy from 12 medical institutions in China. Patients were randomly assigned to receive WLI followed by LCI or LCI followed by WLI. The primary outcome was to compared the diagnostic accuracy between LCI and WLI for EGC/high-grade intraepithelial neoplasms.

AIM To evaluate LCI in diagnostic endoscopy of early gastric cancer and to compare LCI and pathological findings. METHODS Endoscopic images were obtained for 39 patients (43 lesions) with early gastric cancer. Three endoscopists evaluated lesion recognition with white light imaging (WLI) and LCI. Color values in Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1976 L*a*b* color space were used to calculate the color difference (Delta E) between cancer lesions and non-cancer areas. After endoscopic submucosal dissection, blood vessel density in the surface layer of the gastric epithelium was evaluated pathologically. The identical region of interest was selected for analyses of endoscopic images (WLI and LCI) and pathological analyses. RESULTS LCI was superior for lesion recognition (P < 0.0001), and.E between cancer and non-cancer areas was significantly greater with LCI than WLI (29.4 vs 18.6, P < 0.0001).

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether serum HCP5 could be a new diagnostic biomarker. Methods Filtered out the HCP5 from the GEO database. The specificity of HCP5 was verified by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and then the stability of HCP5 was verified by room temperature storage and repeated freeze-thaw experiments. Meanwhile, the accuracy of HCP5 was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) and Sanger sequencing. Simultaneously, the expression level of serum HCP5 was detected by qRT-PCR in 98 patients with primary gastric cancer, 21 gastritis patients, 82 healthy donors, and multiple cancer types. Then, the methodology analysis was carried on. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate its diagnostic efficiency. Results qRT-PCR method had good repeatability and stability in detecting HCP5. The expression level of HCP5 in the serum of gastric cancer patients was remarkably higher than that of healthy controls, and it could distinguish gastritis patients from healthy donors. Besides, the expression of HCP5 was increased dramatically in MKN-45 and MGC-803. The FISH assay showed that HCP5 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of MKN-45 and BGC-823 cells. When HCP5 was combined with existing tumor markers, the diagnostic efficiency of HCP5 was the best, and the combined diagnosis of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen199 (CA199), and HCP5 can significantly improve the diagnostic sensitivity. Besides, compared with the expression levels of thyroid cancer (THCA), colorectal cancer (CRC), and breast cancer (BRCA), serum HCP5 in gastric cancer was the most specific. Moreover, the high expression of serum HCP5 was related to differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and nerve invasion.

Early detection and treatment of CPs through colonoscopy is essential to reduce the incidence of CRC. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is regarded as a risk factor for gastritis and gastric cancer and may also be a risk factor for CPs and CRC. However, few studies based on vast clinical cases exist in China to clarify whether Hp is a risk factor for CPs and CRC, and whether Hp-positive patients need to undergo colonoscopy checks earlier. This article attempts to make up for that deficiency. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted based on 13,037 patients without a treatment history of Hp who underwent their first gastroscopy and colonoscopy simultaneously at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University from January 2018 to December 2019. Pearson chi(2) test and logistic regression were used to determine whether Hp is a risk factor for CPs and CRC. Multifactor analysis of variance was used to define the impact of Hp on CPs prevalence with different ages, sexes. Results For Chinese individuals, Hp is a risk factor for CPs and CRC. The odds ratio (OR) value are 1.228 (95% CI, 1.130 to 1.336) and 1.862 (95% CI 1.240-2.796), respectively. Hp-positive patients have a higher probability of multiple or large intestinal polyps. However, Hp infection does not increase the incidence of adenomas, nor does it affect the pathological type of adenomas. The OR of Hp on the risk of CPs was 1.432 (95%CI 1.275-1.608) for males but increased to 1.937 (95%CI 1.334-2.815) for those aged 35 to 40. For females, the results were similar. Conclusions For the Chinese, Hp is a risk factor for CPs and CRC (OR > 1); the infection of Hp increased CPs risk in Chinese of all ages, especially aged 35-40, suggesting that Hp-positive patients should undergo colonoscopy frequently.",2021/8/26,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,698898,,698898,11,,Front.

The functional properties of identified proteins were further analyzed using PANTHER and STRING databases.Results The differentially expressed protein spots were identified as three candidate proteins: Haptoglobin, Prohibitin, and Apolipoprotein. The protein interaction studies reveal that the haptoglobin fragments were upregulated, and the remaining two prohibitin and Apolipoprotein were down-regulated in gastric cancer patients.Conclusion All the proteins identified as biomarkers were found to be involved in regulating cell proliferation and stabilization of oxidative metabolism in the liver; therefore, differential regulation plays a crucial role in gastric cancer progression.",2024/5/15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:51,,,,,27,,Comb.

However, there has been controversy in the literature with respect to the validity of serum pepsinogen (SPG) for the detection of GC and AG. Consequently, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of SPG in GC and AG detection. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for correlative original studies published up to September 30, 2014. The summary sensitivity, specificity, positive diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR+), negative diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR-), area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were used to evaluate SPG in GC and AG screening based on bivariate random effects models. The inter-study heterogeneity was evaluated by the I-2 statistics and publication bias was assessed using Begg and Mazumdar's test. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to explore study heterogeneity. Results In total, 31 studies involving 1,520 GC patients and 2,265 AG patients were included in the meta-analysis. The summary sensitivity, specificity, DLR+, DLR-, AUC and DOR for GC screening using SPG were 0.69 (95% CI: 0.60-0.76), 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62-0.82), 2.57 (95% CI: 1.82-3.62), and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.34-0.54), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72-0.80) and 6.01 (95% CI: 3.69-9.79), respectively. For AG screening, the summary sensitivity, specificity, DLR+, DLR-, AUC and DOR were 0.69 (95% CI: 0.55-0.80), 0.88 (95% CI: 0.77-0.94), 5.80 (95% CI: 3.06-10.99), and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.24-0.51), 0.85 (95% CI: 0.82-0.88) and 16.50 (95% CI: 8.18-33.28), respectively. In subgroup analysis, the use of combination of concentration of PGI and the ratio of PGI:PGII as measurement of SPG for GC screening yielded sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.66-0.75), specificity of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.79-0.80), DOR of 6.92 (95% CI: 4.36-11.00), and AUC of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.81), while the use of concentration of PGI yielded sensitivity of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.51-0.60), specificity of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76-0.82), DOR of 6.88 (95% CI: 2.30-20.60), and AUC of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92). For AG screening, the use of ratio of PGI:PGII as measurement of SPG yielded sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.52-0.83), specificity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.68-0.93), DOR of 11.51 (95% CI: 6.14-21.56), and AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.80-0.86), the use of combination of concentration of PGI and the ratio of PGI:PGII yield sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72-0.85), specificity of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93), DOR of 24.64 (95% CI: 6.95-87.37), and AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81-0.92), concurrently, the use of concentration of PGI yield sensitivity of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.38-0.54), specificity of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95), DOR of 19.86 (95% CI: 0.86-456.91), and AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.52-1.00).

Prophylactic total gastrectomy is the definitive treatment. Endoscopic surveillance can inform the timing of prophylactic total gastrectomy through detection of microscopic signet ring cell carcinoma foci. However, evidence is scarce about the optimal endoscopic sampling technique and characterisation of signet ring cell carcinoma foci in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. We aimed to formally assess the diagnostic yield of different sampling strategies and to identify criteria for the characterisation of endoscopic lesions.Methods For this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we included individuals aged 18 years or older at the Cambridge University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust who fulfilled testing criteria for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer between June 1, 2005, and July 31, 2021. The primary outcome was detection of intramucosal signet ring cell carcinoma foci. We assessed the detection rate and anatomical location of signet ring cell carcinoma in random biopsy samples taken according to a systematic protocol compared with biopsies targeted to endoscopic findings. Endoscopic lesions were examined with white-light and narrow band imaging with magnification to assess the likelihood of cancerous foci.Findings 145 individuals were included, of whom 68 (47%) were male and 92 (63%) carried the CDH1 pathogenic variant. 58 (40%) patients were diagnosed with invasive signet ring cell carcinoma over a median follow-up time of 51 months (IQR 18-80). The first diagnosis of signet ring cell carcinoma was most commonly made from random biopsies (29 [50%] of 58 patients), rather than targeted biopsies (15 [26%] patients). The anatomical distribution of signet ring cell carcinoma foci detected by random biopsies more accurately reflected those identified in prophylactic total gastrectomy specimens than did targeted biopsies. Omitting random biopsies in our cohort would have led to an under-diagnosis rate of 42%. Using a novel panel of endoscopic criteria, gastric lesions containing signet ring cell carcinoma were predicted with a sensitivity of 67middot3% and a specificity of 90middot2%.Interpretation Random biopsies enhance the early detection of signet ring cell carcinoma and are complementary to targeted biopsies in surveillance of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. This sampling method should be the standard of care when performing all surveillance endoscopies for individuals with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.",Jan-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,107-116,,1,24,,Lancet Oncol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: New York Publisher: Elsevier Science Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:000924634100001,,,,STOMACH; GUIDELINES; GASTRECTOMY; 256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods A case-cohort study was done in adults from the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank study, aged 30-79 years from ten areas in China (Qingdao, Haikou, Harbin, Suzhou, Liuzhou, Henan, Sichuan, Hunan, Gansu, and Zhejiang), and included 500 incident NCGC cases, 437 incident CGC cases, and 500 subcohort participants who were cancerfree and alive within the first two years since enrolment in 2004-08. H pylori biomarkers were measured in stored baseline plasma samples using a sensitive immunoblot assay (HelicoBlot 2.1), with adapted criteria to define H pylori seropositivity. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for NCGC and CGC associated with H pylori infection. These values were used to estimate the number of gastric cancer cases attributable to H pylori infection in China. Findings Of the 512 715 adults enrolled in the China Kadoorie Biobank between June, 2004, and July, 2008, 500 incident NCGC cases, 437 incident CGC cases, and 500 subcohort participants were selected for analysis. The seroprevalence of H pylori was 94.4% (95% CI 92.4-96.4) in NGCG, 92.2% (89.7-94.7) in CGC, and 75.6% (71.8-79.4) in subcohort participants. H pylori infection was associated with adjusted HRs of 5.94 (95% CI 3.25-10.86) for NCGC and 3.06 (1.54-6.10) for CGC. Among the seven individual infection biomarkers, cytotoxin-associated antigen had the highest HRs for both NCGC (HR 4.41, 95% CI 2.60-7.50) and CGC (2.94, 1.53-5.68). In this population, 78.5% of NCGC and 62.1% of CGC cases could be attributable to H pylori infection. H pylori infection accounted for an estimated 339 955 cases of gastric cancer in China in 2018. Interpretation Among Chinese adults, H pylori infection is common and is the cause of large numbers of gastric cancer cases. Population-based mass screening and the eradication of H pylori should be considered to reduce the burden of gastric cancer in high-risk settings. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Here, we determined whether GKN1 is a potential theragnostic marker for gastric cancer. Methods We identified GKN1 binding proteins using the protein microarray assay and investigated whether GKN1 is one of the exosomal cargo proteins by western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescent assays. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed by MTT, BrdU incorporation, flow cytometry, and western blot assays. We further validated the functional relevance of exosomal GKN1 in MKN1-injected xenograft mice. The possibility of serum GKN1 as a diagnostic marker for gastric cancer was determined by ELISA assay. Results In protein microarray assay, GKN1 binding to 27 exosomal proteins was clearly observed. GKN1 was expressed in exosomes derived from HFE-145 gastric epithelial cells by western blot and immunofluorescent assays, but not in exosomes from AGS and MKN1 gastric cancer cells. Exosomes carrying GKN1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both AGS and MKN1 cells, and exosomes carrying GKN1-treated nude mice-bearing MKN1 xenograft tumors exhibited significantly reduced tumor volume and tumor weight. Silencing of clathrin markedly down-regulated the internalization of exosomal GKN1. Interestingly, serum GKN1 concentrations in patients with gastric cancer were significantly lower than those in healthy individuals and patients with colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas.

As shown in our previous study, miR-1290 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and promotes tumor progression. We therefore aimed to explore the potential of circulating miR-1290 as a biomarker for gastrointestinal cancer. Methods A serum miRNA sequencing analysis was performed. Then, circulating miRNA detection technologies were established. The expression of miR-1290 was analyzed in gastrointestinal tumor cell lines and culture supernatants. Expression levels of circulating miR-1290 in clinical samples were examined. Associations between miR-1290 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. Xenograft models were generated to assess the fluctuation in serum miR-1290 levels during disease progression. Results Through miRNA sequencing, we identified that miR-1290 was overexpressed in serum samples from patients with CRC. We confirmed that human gastrointestinal tumor cells express and secrete miR-1290. The circulating miR-1290 levels was up-regulated in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) (p < 0.01), CRC (p < 0.05), and gastric cancer (GC) (p < 0.01). High miR-1290 expression levels were associated with tumor size, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, distant metastasis, tumor differentiation and AJCC stage in patients with PC and CRC. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.8857 in patients with PC, with 60.9% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity. The AUC was 0.7852 in patients with CRC, with 42.0% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity. In patients with GC, the AUC was 0.6576, with 26.0% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity.

Currently, there are no inexpensive, non-invasive and simple techniques that can be employed in poor resource settings for early case detection. In this study, we explored the possibility using blood in gastric juice as a screening tool to identify patients requiring referral for endoscopy. Methods The study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital endoscopy unit in Lusaka, Zambia. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy, gastric juice was aspirated and the pH determined using pH paper test strips. The presence of blood was tested using urinalysis reagent strips. Results We enrolled 276 patients; 147(53%) were female and median age was 49 years (IQR 40-64 years). The presence of blood was associated with mucosal lesions, [OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.7, P = 0.004].

Understanding the health and economic factors that affect screening cost-effectiveness in different countries will help address when and where it makes most sense to screen for gastric cancer. Methods We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model to compare screening and surveillance strategies for gastric cancer in Brazil, France, Japan, Nigeria, and the United States. Primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We then performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how each variable affected the overall model. Results In all countries, the most cost-effective strategies, measured by incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to no screening, were screening every 10 years, surveillance of high- and low-risk patients every 5 and 10 years, respectively, and screening every 5 years. Only Japan had at least one cost-effective screening strategy. The most important variables across different screening strategies and countries were starting age of screening, cost of endoscopy, and baseline probability of local gastric cancer at time of diagnosis.

Helicobacter pylori is responsible for 70% of gastric cancers globally, and patients with this bacterial infection often present with early stages of the carcinogenic pathway such as inflammation or gastritis. Although many patients continue to progress to advanced-stage disease after antibacterial treatment, there are no follow-up screening protocols for patients with a history of H. pylori. Methods Several biomarkers (Lgr5, CD133, CD44) become upregulated during gastric carcinogenesis. A logistic regression model is developed using clinical data from 59 patients at different stages of the carcinogenic pathway to identify the likelihood of being at an advanced stage of disease for all combinations of age, sex, and marker positivity. Using these likelihood distributions and the observed rate of marker positivity increase, time to high likelihood (probability > 0.8) of advanced disease for individual patients is predicted. Results A strong correlation between marker positivity and disease stage was found for all three markers. Disease stage was accurately classified by the respective regression models for more than 86% of retrospective patients. Highly patient-specific predictions of time to onset of dysplasia were made, allowing the classification of 17 patients initially diagnosed with intestinal metaplasia into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories. Conclusions We present an approach designed to integrate pathology, mathematics, and statistics for detection of the earliest precancerous, treatable lesion. Given the simplicity and robustness of the framework, such technique has the potential to guide personalized screening schedules to minimize the risk of undetected malignant transformation.",Mar-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,196-203,,2,21,,Gastric Cancer,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 8 Place: New York Publisher: Springer Web of Science ID: WOS:000426564700002,,,,Stomach neoplasms; EXPRESSION; INVASION; Early detection of cancer; CARCINOGENESIS; Helicobacter pylori; CD44; CD133; STEM-CELL MARKERS; 778,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to perform visual tasks has been recently developed. The aim of this study was to build a system using the DCNN to detect early gastric cancer (EGC) without blind spots during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Methods 3170 gastric cancer and 5981 benign images were collected to train the DCNN to detect EGC. A total of 24549 images from different parts of stomach were collected to train the DCNN to monitor blind spots.

The purpose of the present study is to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PGLS) in gastric cancer. Methods The protein extracted from a panel of four pairs of gastric cancer tissues and adjacent tissues, labeled with iTRAQ (8-plex) reagents, and followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The expressions of proteins were further validated by immunohistochemistry analysis. The expression levels of mRNA were analyzed and validated in the Oncomine database. The correlations of PGLS with prognostic outcomes were evaluated with Kaplan-Meier plotter database. Results The present study found that PGLS was significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer by using iTRAQ-based proteomics and immunohistochemistry analysis. The sensitivity of PGLS in gastric cancer was 72.9%. The high expression of PGLS was significantly correlated with TNM staging in gastric cancer (p = 0.02). The overexpression of PGLS predicts worse overall survival (OS) and post-progression survival (PPS) for gastric cancer (OS, HR = 1.48, p = 2.1e-05; PPS, HR = 1.35, p = 0.015). Specifically, the high PGLS expression predicts poor OS, PPS in male gastric cancer patients, in patients with lymph node metastasis and in patients with Her-2 (-). Conclusions These findings suggested that PGLS was aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer and predicts poor overall survival, post-progression survival for gastric cancer patients.

Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with poor prognosis. A non-invasive assay for the detection of early-stage gastric cancer is highly desirable for reducing associated mortality.Methods We collected a prospective study cohort of 110 stage I-II gastric cancer patients and 139 non-cancer individuals. We performed whole-genome sequencing with plasma samples and profiled four types of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) characteristics, fragment size pattern, copy number variation, nucleosome coverage pattern, and single nucleotide substitution. With these differential profiles, we developed an ensemble model to detect gastric cancer signals. Further, we validated the assay in an in-house first validation cohort of 73 gastric cancer patients and 94 non-cancer individuals and an independent second validation cohort of 47 gastric cancer patients and 49 non-cancer individuals. Additionally, we evaluated the assay in a hypothetical 100,000 screening population by Monte Carlo simulation.Results Our cfDNA-based assay could distinguish early-stage gastric cancer from non-cancer at an AUROC of 0.962 (95% CI: 0.942-0.982) in the study cohort, 0.972 (95% CI: 0.953-0.992) in the first validation cohort and 0.937 (95% CI: 0.890-0.983) in the second validation cohort. The model reached a specificity of 92.1% (128/139) and a sensitivity of 88.2% (97/110) in the study cohort. In the first validation cohort, 91.5% (86/94) of non-cancer individuals and 91.8% (67/73) of gastric cancer patients were correctly identified. In the second validation cohort, 89.8% (44/49) of non-cancer individuals and 87.2% (41/47) of gastric cancer patients were accurately classified.Conclusions We introduced a liquid biopsy assay using multiple dimensions of cfDNA characteristics that could accurately identify early-stage gastric cancer from non-cancerous conditions.

We measured the inequity in accessibility to endoscopic mucosal/submucosal resection (EMR) for early and curable gastric cancer treatment among different income classes in patients diagnosed from late 2011 to 2013. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Cooperation Claim Data from patients diagnosed from late 2011 until the end of 2013, to provide a total of 1,671 patients with newly diagnosed carcinoma in situ of gastric and gastric cancer among 1,025,340 enrollees. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the associations between independent variables and the rate of treatment with EMR. Among 1671 gastric cancer patients, 317 (19.0 %) subjects were treated with EMR. The 'lowest' income group was associated with a statistically significant lower rate of EMR treatment [odds ratio (OR) = 0.55, 95 % confidence index (CI) 0.34-0.89] compared to the 'highest' income group. The ORs for the 'low-middle' and 'middle-high' income groups were both higher than for the reference group, although these were not significantly different. According to the subgroup analysis by gender, rate of EMR treatment of 'lowest' income group (OR = 0.37, 95 % CI 0.18-0.74) was significantly lower only among men. In conclusion, we suggest that although universal health insurance in Korea has covered EMR treatment since August 2011, patients from the lowest income group are less likely to receive this treatment.

Screening for gastric cancer greatly relies on endoscopy and pathology biopsy, which are invasive and pose financial burdens. Thus, the prevention of the disease by modifying lifestyle-related behaviors and dietary habits or even the prevention of risk factor formation is of great importance. This study aimed to construct an inexpensive, non-invasive, fast, and high-precision diagnostic model using six machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify patients at high or low risk of developing gastric cancer by analyzing individual lifestyle factors.Methods This retrospective study used the data of 2029 individuals from the gastric cancer database of Ayatollah Taleghani Hospital in Abadan City, Iran. The data were randomly separated into training and test sets (ratio 0.7:0.3). Six ML methods, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) (linear kernel), SVM (RBF kernel), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) (K = 1, 3, 7, 9), random forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were trained to construct prognostic models before and after performing the relief feature selection method. Finally, to evaluate the models' performance, the metrics derived from the confusion matrix were calculated via a test split and cross-validation.Results This study found 11 important influence factors for the risk of gastric cancer, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, high salt intake, and chronic atrophic gastritis, among other factors. Comparisons indicated that the XGBoost had the best performance for the risk prediction of gastric cancer.Conclusions The results suggest that based on simple baseline patient data, the ML techniques have the potential to start the prescreening of gastric cancer and identify high-risk individuals who should proceed with invasive examinations. Our model could also considerably lessen the number of cases that need endoscopic surveillance.

Typically, ulcerous and cancerous tissues develop abnormal morphologies through courses of progression. Endoscopy is a routinely adopted means for examination of gastrointestinal tract for malignancy. Early and timely detection of malignancy closely correlate with good prognosis. Repeated presentation of similar frames from gastrointestinal tract endoscopy often weakens attention for practitioners to result in true patients missed out to incur higher medical cost and unnecessary morbidity. Highly needed is an automatic means for spotting visual abnormality and prompts for attention for medical staff for more thorough examination. Methods We conduct classification of benign ulcer and cancer for gastrointestinal endoscopic color images using deep neural network and transfer-learning approach. Using clinical data gathered from Gil Hospital, we built a dataset comprised of 200 normal, 367 cancer, and 220 ulcer cases, and applied the inception, ResNet, and VGGNet models pretrained on ImageNet. Three classes were defined-normal, benign ulcer, and cancer, and three separate binary classifiers were built-those for normal vs cancer, normal vs ulcer, and cancer vs ulcer for the corresponding classification tasks. For each task, considering inherent randomness entailed in the deep learning process, we performed data partitioning and model building experiments 100 times and averaged the performance values. Results Areas under curves of respective receiver operating characteristics were 0.95, 0.97, and 0.85 for the three classifiers. The ResNet showed the highest level of performance. The cases involving normal, i.e., normal vs ulcer and normal vs cancer resulted in accuracies above 90%. The case of ulcer vs cancer classification resulted in a lower accuracy of 77.1%, possibly due to smaller difference in appearance than those cases involving normal. Conclusions The overall level of performance of the proposed method was very promising to encourage applications in clinical environments. Automatic classification using deep learning technique as proposed can be used to complement manual inspection efforts for practitioners to minimize dangers of missed out positives resulting from repetitive sequence of endoscopic frames and weakening attentions.",Nov-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:04,,3790-3797,,11,33,,Surg.

This study aimed to identify novel circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for the early detection of GC. Methods Candidate miRNA was identified after integrated analysis of two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and clinical serum samples. Exosomes extracted were verified using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and western blot. The expressions of miRNAs were tested through qRT-PCR. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to explore the diagnostic utility of miRNAs. RNA pull-down assay was used to find RNA binding proteins (RBPs) which transport candidate miRNA into exosomes. Bioinformatics analysis of candidate miRNA was conducted using DAVID and Cytoscape. Results After integrated analysis of two GEO datasets, six circulating miRNAs were found to be consistently upregulated in GC patients. Then, qRT-PCR demonstrated that serum miR-1246 was the one with the largest fold change. Studies in vitro revealed that elevated serum miR-1246 was tumor-derived by being packaged into exosomes with the help of ELAVL1. Thereafter, we discovered that exosomal miR-1246 expressions in serum could differentiate GC patients with TNM stage I from healthy controls (HCs) and patients with benign diseases (BDs) with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.843 and 0.811, respectively.

GC patients are largely threatened owing to metastasis and drug resistance. Tumor angiogenesis plays an important role in the development of gastric cancer and is a challenge in the treatment of gastric cancer. Methods Mouse xenograft models were used for screening of therapeutic peptides on GC growth and metastasis. Routine laboratory experimental methods including conditional cell culture, tube formation assay, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), ubiquitination assay, and immunofluorescence (IF) were used in mechanism investigation; protein docking analysis and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) were used for prediction and confirmation of interactions between JP3/SP1 and TRIM25/MEK1/2. Results We identified an MMP2-targeted peptide JP3 that plays inhibiting roles in modulating growth and metastasis of GC in vivo and has no observable toxic side effects. JP3 reduced tumor microvessel density (MVD) in vivo and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) tube formation in vitro. Mechanistic studies revealed that JP3 reduces polyubiquitination-mediated degradation of TRIM25 by increasing the stability of TRIM25 through phosphorylating it at Ser12. TRIM25, as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoted the ubiquitin of SP1 at K610, further suppressed expression of MMP2 and inhibited angiogenesis in GC. Importantly, the inversely association between TRIM25 and SP1 protein level was further verified in human GC tissues. Decreased TRIM25 expression and increased SP1 expression in tumor tissues were positively correlated with poor prognosis of GC patients. Conclusions MMP2-targeted peptide JP3 plays a therapeutic role in GC through anti-angiogenesis by modulating TRIM25/SP1/MMP2.",2020/6/23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:02,,118,,1,39,,J. Exp. Clin.

Korean National Cancer Screening Program (KNCSP) offer either upper gastrointestinal series (UGIS) or upper endoscopy biennially for adults aged >= 40. This study aimed to investigate the effect of cancer screening program on the long-term survival among GC patients. Methods A nationwide population-based cohort was constructed based on three national databases. Overall, 46,701 GC patients diagnosed in 2008 and 2009 were included in our final analysis, and they were followed-up until the end of 2019. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was used to report the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Results A total of 18,614/46,701 (39.9%) patients died during the median follow-up time of 10.5 years. The survival rate was higher among screened patients (65.8%) than never-screened patients (49.1%). Screened patients had 53% (HR, 0.47; 95% CI 0.45-0.48) lower risk of death from GC. The HRs of GC-specific mortality was lower in upper endoscopy group (HR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.34-0.37) compared with UGIS (HR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.67-0.73). Screened patients within 2 years prior to cancer diagnosis had a 35% reduction in risk of GC death. The figure decline to approximately 19% among patients with interval time since last screening of > 3 years. Conclusions Our findings emphasized the positive effects of GC screening on long-term GC patient survival.

Therefore, we conducted this study to develop a biomarker for GC detection, consisting of urinary microRNAs (miRNAs). Methods We matched 306 participants by age and sex [153 pairs consisting of patients with GC and healthy controls (HCs)], then randomly divided them across three groups: (1) the discovery cohort (4 pairs); (2) the training cohort (95 pairs); and (3) the validation cohort (54 pairs). Results There were 22 urinary miRNAs with significantly aberrant expressions between the two groups in the discovery cohort. Upon multivariate analysis of the training cohort, urinary expression levels of miR-6807-5p and miR-6856-5p were significantly independent biomarkers for diagnosis of GC, in addition to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status. A diagnostic panel that combined these 2 miRNAs and H. pylori status distinguished between HC and GC samples with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.736. In the validation cohort, urinary miR-6807-5p and miR-6856-5p showed significantly higher expression levels in the GC group, and the combination biomarker panel of miR-6807-5p, miR-6856-5p, and H. pylori status also showed excellent performance (AUC = 0.885). In addition, this biomarker panel could distinguish between HC and stage I GC patients with an AUC = 0.748.

Gastric cancer screening is one of the effective strategies used to reduce mortality. We expect that good biomarkers can be discovered to diagnose and treat gastric cancer as early as possible. Methods We download four gene expression profiling datasets of gastric cancer (GSE118916, GSE54129, GSE103236, GSE112369), which were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues were detected to explore biomarkers that may play an important role in gastric cancer. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of overlap genes were conducted by the Metascape online database; the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by the STRING online database, and we screened the hub genes of the PPI network using the Cytoscape software. The survival curve analysis was conducted by km-plotter and the stage plots of hub genes were created by the GEPIA online database. PCR, WB, and immunohistochemistry were used to verify the expression of hub genes. A neural network model was established to quantify the predictors of gastric cancer. Results The relative expression level of cadherin-3 (CDH3), lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), and matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) were significantly higher in gastric samples, compared with the normal groups (p<0.05). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the effect of the three genes' expression on gastric cancer, and the AUC was used to determine the degree of confidence: CDH3 (AUC = 0.800, P<0.05, 95% CI =0.857-0.895), LEF1 (AUC=0.620, P<0.05, 95%CI=0.632-0.714), and MMP7 (AUC=0.914, P<0.05, 95%CI=0.714-0.947).

Despite recent improvements in the treatment of GC, the prognosis is not yet satisfactory for GC patients.CYT997, a novel microtubule-targeting agent, recently has been identified to be a promising anticancer candidate for the treatment of cancers; however, the effects of CYT997 in GC remain largely unknown. Methods Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CCK8 assay and flow cytometry. The mitochondrial ROS were detected by confocal microscope and flow cytometry. Gastric cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model was used to evaluate its antitumor activity of CYT997 in vivo. Results CYT997 inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis and triggered autophagy. CYT997 induced apoptosis through triggering intracellular mitochondrial ROS generation in GC cells. ROS scavengers N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Mitoquinone (MitoQ) distinctly weakened CYT997-induced cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis in GC cells. Pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA promoted the effect of CYT997 on cells apoptosis. Mechanistically, CYT997 performed its function through regulation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in GC cells. In addition, CYT997 inhibited growth of gastric cancer patient-derived xenograft(PDX) tumors.

However, the clinical relevance of circular RNAs (circRNAs) as GC biomarkers remains largely unexplored. AIM To evaluate the potential of novel circRNA circ_0004592 in the early screening and prognosis of GC. METHODS High-throughput sequencing of circRNAs was performed to screen for potential target molecules. Circ_0004592 expression was examined in GC tissues, cells, and plasma. Plasma samples were collected from healthy subjects' patients, as well as from patients with benign lesions, precancerous lesions, and GC, whereafter the diagnostic accuracy of circ_0004592 was evaluated. The correlation between circ_0004592 levels in plasma and clinicopathological data of patients with GC was further analyzed. RESULTS Circ_0004592 was upregulated in both the tissue and plasma of patients with GC. Further, circ_0004592 expression was higher in patients with precancerous lesions than in healthy controls while being highest in patients with GC. In the same patient, the postoperative plasma level of circ_0004592 was lower than that in the preoperative period. Moreover, circ_0004592 level was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, tumor depth, and lymph node metastasis. The area under the curve (AUC) of plasma circ_0004592 exhibited high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating patients with GC from healthy donors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA), a transmembrane protein located in the epithelium for Na+ and K+ transportation, and E-cadherin, which are both crucial for the epithelium and adherens junction, as potential gastric cancer biomarkers. Methods 45 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma were recruited. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were conducted to for localization of NKA alpha 1-, beta 1-isoform, and E-cadherin. NKA enzyme activity was determined by NADH-linked methods and immunoblotting of NKA alpha 1-, beta 1-isoform, and E-cadherin were performed to evaluate protein expression. Results Immunostaining revealed that NKA was co-localized with E-cadherin in the glands of the gastric epithelium. Both NKA activity and alpha 1-isoform protein expression were reduced in the study group (P < 0.05), indicating impaired NKA functions. In the adherens junctions, the NKA beta 1-isoform and E-cadherin were significantly reduced in the study groups (P < 0.05), indicating the adhesion force between cells may have been weakened. Conclusions A significant decrease in NKA function (protein and activity) and E-cadherin in tumor lesions appear promising biomarker for gastric adenocarcinoma. Therefore, developing screening methods for detecting NKA function may be beneficial for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer. In our knowledge, this study was the first to investigate the NKA and E-cadherin expression in the relation of gastric adenocarcinoma in human patients.",2017/8/23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:09,,e0183692,,8,12,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000408355800083,,,,"CANCER; PATHWAY; EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; CELL-ADHESION; JUNCTIONS; NA,K-ATPASE; NA+/K+-ATPASE; PUMP; SUBUNIT; SUPPRESSION; 820",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This delayed diagnosis leads to poor clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for an effective and non-invasive method for early detection. Recent advances in cancer epigenetics have led to the identification of biomarkers that have the potential to revolutionize the early detection and monitoring of this disease. One such promising biomarker is the methylation of the FGFR2 promoter. This study aims to measure the methylation levels of a specific CpG site in the FGFR2 promoter gene in DNA extracted from blood leukocytes from patients with intestinal metaplasia, gastric cancer, and healthy control. Material and methods The CpG site of the FGFR2 gene promoter was identified in its control region. Methylation alteration of the selected FGFR2 CpG site was determined through the (methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme) MSRE-qPCR. Genomic DNA was extracted from one hundred twenty-five participants. Results The normal group had mean methylation levels of 93.23 +/- 4.929%, while the IM group had a level of 69.85 +/- 27.15%. In GC patients, the levels varied, with 25.96 +/- 18.98% in the intestinal type and 28.30 +/- 16.07% in the diffuse type. The methylation levels in the IM and GC patients were significantly lower than those in the normal control group. However, no significant difference was observed between the methylation status of the intestinal type of GC and the diffuse type. The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that FGFR2 CpG methylation levels in GC patients compared to normal controls had a high sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100%, with a cut-off of < 74.25%; when GC patients were compared to IM patients, the sensitivity was 85%, and the specificity was 80%, with a cut-off < 44.45%. Conclusions The potential of the FGFR2 methylation status as a non-invasive biomarker lies in its ability to be detected in blood leukocytes, which makes it a promising tool for the early detection of intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer.

Patients Faecal calprotectin was measured in samples from 39 patients with known oesophago-gastric cancer and in 191 samples from control subjects. Results The median calprotectin concentration was<20 mu g/g (range<20-421 mu g/g) in control subjects and 97 mu g/g (range<20-940 mu g/g) in patients with oesophago-gastric cancer (P<0.001).

Aim The aim of this study was to determine the long-term accuracy of the pepsinogen test (PG) for early diagnosis of gastric cancer. Participants and methods A cohort of inhabitants from the Northern part of Portugal, aged between 40 and 74 years (n = 5913) , subjected to the PG test (PGI <= 70 ng/ml and PGI/PGII <= 3), were followed up between November 2006 and December 2015. The diagnosis of gastric cancer was determined through linkage to the population-based registry of cancer [North Region Cancer Registry of Portugal (RORENO)]. Results Twenty-six gastric cancers were diagnosed (0.4%): nine (4%) among individuals 'positive' for the PG test (n = 225) and 15 (0.3%) among those who were 'negative' (n = 5688) [heard ratio = 12.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.6-28.6]. Individuals with a 'negative PG test' had a 3-year risk of gastric cancer of 0.1%, representing a sensitivity of 35% (95% CI: 17-56%), globally, and of 58% (95% CI: 28-85%) at 3 years follow-up. The median survival rate in both groups was over 24 months.

An artificial intelligence system has been shown to monitor blind spots during EGD. In this study, we updated the system (ENDOANGEL), verified its effectiveness in improving endoscopy quality, and pretested its performance in detecting EGC in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Methods ENDOANGEL was developed using deep convolutional neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Patients undergoing EGD in five hospitals were randomly assigned to the ENDOANGEL- assisted group or to a control group without use of ENDOANGEL. The primary outcome was the number of blind spots. Secondary outcomes included performance of ENDOANGEL in predicting EGC in a clinical setting. Results 1050 patients were randomized, and 498 and 504 patients in the ENDOANGEL and control groups, respectively, were analyzed. Compared with the control group, the ENDOANGEL group had fewer blind spots (mean 5.38 [standard deviation (SD) 4.32] vs. 9.82 [SD 4.98]; P < 0.001) and longer inspection time (5.40 [SD 3.82] vs. 4.38 [SD 3.91] minutes; P < 0.001). In the ENDOANGEL group, 196 gastric lesions with pathological results were identified. ENDOANGEL correctly predicted all three EGCs (one mucosal carcinoma and two high grade neoplasias) and two advanced gastric cancers, with a per-lesion accuracy of 84.7%, sensitivity of 100 %, and specificity of 84.3% for detecting gastric cancer.

Methods We performed endoscopic screening with esophageal iodine staining and oropharyngolaryngeal inspection in 7582 Japanese alcohol-dependent men (40-79 years) during 1993-2018, and retrospectively investigated their initial screening results. Results The 2008-2018 screening showed lower detection rates for ESCC (2.6% vs 4.0%, P = .0009) and GA (0.5% vs 1.4%, P < .0001) for all age brackets, compared with the 1993-2007 screening. The HNSCC detection rate did not change (1.0% vs 1.1%). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the 2008-2018 screening had a reduced OR (95% CI) for ESCC (0.34 [0.25-0.47]) and GA (0.19 [0.10-0.35]), compared with the 1993-2007 screening. The reduction in H pylori infection is probably the main reason for the decrease in GA detection over time. Declining trends in pack-years and gastric atrophy and increasing trends in age and body mass index (BMI) were found over time. The presence of advanced gastric atrophy increased the risk for ESCC as well as GA. The inactive heterozygous aldehyde dehydrogenase-2*1/*2 genotype was a strong risk factor for ESCC, HNSCC, and GA. Fewer pack-years and a larger BMI decreased the ESCC risk. However, these confounders cannot fully explain why the incidence of ESCC has decreased markedly over the recent decade. Conclusions The detection rates of ESCC and GA have markedly decreased during the past decade in the alcohol-dependent population.

However, it relies on naked-eye evaluation by endoscopists, and the histopathologic confirmation is time-consuming. We aimed to visualize and measure the activity of various enzymes through two-photon microscopy (TPM) using fluorescent probes and assess its diagnostic potential in gastric cancer. Methods beta-Galactosidase (beta-gal), carboxylesterase (CES), and human NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase (hNQO1) enzyme activities in the normal mucosa, ulcer, adenoma, and gastric cancer biopsy samples were measured using two-photon enzyme probes. The fluorescence emission ratio at long and short wavelengths (Ch2/Ch1) for each probe was comparatively analyzed. Approximately 8,000 - 9,000 sectional images in each group were obtained by measuring the Ch2/Ch1 ratio according to the tissue depth. Each probe was cross-validated by measuring enzymatic activity from a solution containing lysed tissue. Results Total of 76 subjects were enrolled in this pilot study (normal 21, ulcer 18, adenoma 17, and cancer 20 patients, respectively). There were significant differences in the mean ratio values of beta-gal (0.656 +/- 0.142 vs. 1.127 +/- 0.109, P < 0.001) and CES (0.876 +/- 0.049 vs. 0.579 +/- 0.089, P < 0.001) between the normal and cancer, respectively. The mean ratio value of cancer tissues was different compared to ulcer and adenoma (P < 0.001). The hNQO1 activity showed no significant difference between cancer and other conditions. Normal mucosa and cancer were visually and quantitatively distinguished through beta-gal and CES analyses using TPM images, and enzymatic activity according to depth, was determined using sectional TPM ratiometric images. The results obtained from lysis buffer-treated tissue were consistent with TPM results. Conclusions TPM imaging using ratiometric fluorescent probes enabled the discrimination of gastric cancer from normal, ulcer, and adenoma. This novel method can help in a visual differentiation and provide quantitative depth profiling in gastric cancer diagnosis.",2021/8/27,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,634219,,634219,11,,Front.

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of endoscopy and endoscopic surveillance on the early detection of gastric cancer (GC), GC staging, and treatment selection. Methods Patients with GC diagnosed at our center from 2010 to 2022 were retrospectively analyzed and allocated to the short-interval group (had received endoscopy within 3 years before diagnosis), the long-interval group (had received endoscopy more than 3 years before diagnosis), and the unchecked group (had not received endoscopy before diagnosis). The differences in GC staging and treatment modalities among the three groups were analyzed, and the differences in the clinical and pathological features of EGC were further analyzed. Results One thousand and twenty-five GC patients were included, with 395 cases of EGC and 630 cases of advanced GC. The proportions of EGC in the short-interval, long-interval, and unchecked groups were 98.0%, 84.2%, and 29.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). Among the 387 lesions of 367 EGC patients were resected by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), 341 (88.1%) exhibited curative resection, and 46 (11.9%) involved noncurative resections. Lesions of EGC differed significantly in diameter, depth of invasion, and curative resection rate (p = 0.033, 0.019, and 0.005, respectively). In the short-interval group, 87.8% of the lesions were <= 2 cm, 95.6% of the invasion depths were confined to the mucosal layer, and 96.7% of the eCura scores were A or B. Compared with the unchecked group, they had smaller diameters (RR = 0.419, 95% CI 0.234-0.752), shallower invasion depths (RR = 0.286, 95% CI 0.105-0.777), and a higher curative resection rate (RR = 0.215, 95% CI 0.068-0.676). Conclusion Endoscopic surveillance at 3-year intervals can help detect EGC, and the EGC lesions found have smaller diameters and shallower depths of invasion, helping improve the curative resection rate of ESD.

However, diagnostic accuracy of EUS is affected by several factors. In particular, it is difficult to differentiate between T1a and T1b EGC through EUS. AIM To confirm whether submucosal saline injection (SSI) could improve the accuracy of EUS in distinguishing T1a and T1b lesions in EGC. METHODS Twenty-four patients with EGC were examined by EUS and subsequently by SSI combined EUS to compare the degree of tumor invasion. Then, they underwent endoscopic or surgical resection within 7 d. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS and SSI combined EUS was evaluated based on the final pathological findings postoperatively. Saline injected into the submucosa acted as an echoic contrast enhancing agent and had the effect of distinguishing the mucosal and submucosal layers clearly. RESULTS Of total 24 patients, 23 were diagnosed with EGC (T1 cancer: 13 as T1a, and 10 as T1b). Standard EUS identified 6 of 13 T1a cancer patients and 3 of 10 T1b cancer patients. Whereas, EUS-SSI identified 12 of 13 T1a cancer patients and 6 of 10 T1b cancer patients. In this study, SSI combined EUS was more accurate than EUS alone in diagnosing T1a and T1b lesions of EGC (75.0% and 37.5%, respectively).

However, it is difficult for non-experts to accurately diagnose EGC using ECS. In this study, we developed and evaluated a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based system for ECS-aided EGC diagnosis. Methods We constructed a CNN based on a residual neural network with a training dataset comprising 906 images from 61 EGC cases and 717 images from 65 noncancerous gastric mucosa (NGM) cases. To evaluate diagnostic ability, we used an independent test dataset comprising 313 images from 39 EGC cases and 235 images from 33 NGM cases. The test dataset was further evaluated by three endoscopists, and their findings were compared with CNN-based results. Results The trained CNN required 7.0 s to analyze the test dataset. The area under the curve of the total ECS images was 0.93. The CNN produced 18 false positives from 7 NGM lesions and 74 false negatives from 28 EGC lesions. In the per-image analysis, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 83.2%, 76.4%, 92.3%, 93.0%, and 74.6%, respectively, with the CNN and 76.8%, 73.4%, 81.3%, 83.9%, and 69.6%, respectively, for the endoscopist-derived values. The CNN-based findings had significantly higher specificity than the findings determined by all endoscopists. In the per-lesion analysis, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the CNN-based findings were 86.1%, 82.1%, 90.9%, 91.4%, and 81.1%, respectively, and those of the results calculated by the endoscopists were 82.4%, 79.5%, 85.9%, 86.9%, and 78.0%, respectively.

Exploring the roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in tumorigenesis and progression may help to identify new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. In the present study, we investigated the role and regulatory mechanism of hsa_circ_0004872 in gastric cancer (GC). Methods qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of hsa_circ_0004872 in GC tissues and cells. EdU, CCK-8, transwell and scratch wound healing assays were used to assess the role of hsa_circ_0004872 in GC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, respectively. Subcutaneous and tail vein tumor injections in nude mice were used to assess the role of hsa_circ_0004872 in vivo. RIP assay, biotin-coupled probe pull-down assay, FISH and luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm the relationship between hsa_circ_0004872 and the identified miRNA. ChIP assay, luciferase reporter assay and western blot were used to determine the direct binding of Smad4 to the promoter of the ADAR1 gene. Results In this study, we found that hsa_circ_0004872 was dramatically downregulated in GC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. The expression level of hsa_circ_0004872 was associated with tumor size and local lymph node metastasis. Enforced expression of hsa_circ_0004872 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells, whereas knockdown of hsa_circ_0004872 had the opposite effects. Nude mice experiments showed that ectopic expression of hsa_circ_0004872 dramatically inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that hsa_circ_0004872 acted as a ""molecular sponge"" for miR-224 to upregulate the expression of the miR-224 downstream targets p21 and Smad4. Importantly, we found that the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 inhibited hsa_circ_0004872 expression and further led to the upregulation of miR-224. Smad4, the downstream target of miR-224, could further affect hsa_circ_0004872 levels by directly binding to the promoter region of ADAR1 to inhibit ADAR1 expression. Conclusions Our findings showed that hsa_circ_0004872 acted as a tumor suppressor in GC by forming a negative regulatory loop consisting of hsa_circ_0004872/miR-224/Smad4/ADAR1. Thus, hsa_circ_0004872 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for GC.",2020/11/10,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:01,,157,,1,19,,Mol.

We aimed to develop, validate, and evaluate a questionnaire-based GC risk assessment tool for risk prediction and stratification in the Chinese population. Methods In this three-stage multicenter study, we first selected eligible variables by Cox regression models and constructed a GC risk score (GCRS) based on regression coefficients in 416,343 subjects (aged 40-75 years) from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB, development cohort). In the same age range, we validated the GCRS effectiveness in 13,982 subjects from another independent Changzhou cohort (validation cohort) as well as in 5348 subjects from an endoscopy screening program in Yangzhou. Finally, we categorized participants into low (bottom 20%), intermediate (20-80%), and high risk (top 20%) groups by the GCRS distribution in the development cohort. Results The GCRS using 11 questionnaire-based variables demonstrated a Harrell's C-index of 0.754 (95% CI, 0.745-0.762) and 0.736 (95% CI, 0.710-0.761) in the two cohorts, respectively. In the validation cohort, the 10-year risk was 0.34%, 1.05%, and 4.32% for individuals with a low (<= 13.6), intermediate (13.7 similar to 30.6), and high (>= 30.7) GCRS, respectively. In the endoscopic screening program, the detection rate of GC varied from 0.00% in low-GCRS individuals, 0.27% with intermediate GCRS, to 2.59% with high GCRS.

We performed genome-wide long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) microarray analysis to identify and validate novel GC biomarkers depending on a high-risk population cohort.Methods LncRNA profiles were described using the Human LncRNA Microarray between GC and control plasma samples. The differential candidate lncRNAs were validated in two stages by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We further evaluated the joint effect between the GC-associated lncRNA and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection on the risk of cardia and non-cardia GC, respectively.Results Different lncRNA expression profiles were identified between GC and control plasma with a total of 1206 differential lncRNAs including 470 upregulated and 736 downregulated in GC compared with the control group.

However, there is still no perfect biomarker available for the detection of early gastric cancer. This study aimed to investigate the alterations in the plasma metabolites of early gastric cancer using metabolomics and lipidomics based on high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), which detected potential biomarkers that could be used for clinical diagnosis.Methods To investigate the changes in metabolomics and lipidomics, a total of 30 plasma samples were collected, consisting of 15 patients with early gastric cancer and 15 healthy controls. Extensive HPLC-MS-based untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic investigations were conducted. Differential metabolites and metabolic pathways were uncovered through the utilization of statistical analysis and bioinformatics analysis. Candidate biomarker screening was performed using support vector machine-based multivariate receiver operating characteristic analysis.Results A disturbance was observed in a combined total of 19 metabolites and 67 lipids of the early gastric cancer patients. The analysis of KEGG pathways showed that the early gastric cancer patients experienced disruptions in the arginine biosynthesis pathway, the pathway for alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, as well as the pathway for glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. Plasma metabolomics and lipidomics have identified multiple biomarker panels that can effectively differentiate early gastric cancer patients from healthy controls, exhibiting an area under the curve exceeding 0.9.Conclusion These metabolites and lipids could potentially serve as biomarkers for the screening of early gastric cancer, thereby optimizing the strategy for the detection of early gastric cancer.

However, due to the lack of typical symptoms and the difficulty in diagnosing EGC, no effective biomarkers exist for the detection of EGC, and gastroscopy is the only detection method. AIM To provide new biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity through analyzed the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in EGC and AGC and compared them with those in benign gastritis (BG). METHODS We examined the differentially expressed miRNAs in the plasma of 30 patients with EGC, AGC, and BG by miRNA chip analysis. Then, we analyzed and selected the significantly different miRNAs using bioinformatics. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed the relative transcription level of these miRNAs in another 122 patients, including patients with EGC, AGC, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-negative gastritis (Control-1), and H. pylori-positive atrophic gastritis (Control-2). To establish a diagnostic model for the detection of plasma miRNA in EGC, we chose miRNAs that can be used to determine EGC and AGC from Control-1 and Control-2 and miRNAs in EGC from all other groups. RESULTS Among the expression profiles of the miRNA chips in the three groups in the discovery set, of 117 aberrantly expressed miRNAs, 30 confirmed target prediction, whereas 14 were included as potential miRNAs. The RT-qPCR results showed that 14 potential miRNAs expression profiles in the two groups exhibited no differences in terms of H. pylori-negative gastritis (Control-1) and H. pylori-positive atrophic gastritis (Control-2). Hence, these two groups were incorporated into the Control group. A combination of four types of miRNAs, miR-7641, miR-425-5p, miR-1180-3p and miR-122-5p, were used to effectively distinguish the Cancer group (EGC + AGC) from the Control group [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.799, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.691-0.908, P < 0.001]. Additionally, miR-425-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-1180-3p and miR-122-5p were utilized to distinguish EGC from the Control group (AUC = 0.829, 95% CI: 0.657-1.000, P = 0.001). Moreover, the miR-24-3p expression level in EGC was lower than that in the AGC (AUC = 0.782, 95% CI: 0.571-0.993, P = 0.029), and the miR-4632-5p expression level in EGC was significantly higher than that in AGC (AUC = 0.791, 95% CI: 0.574-1.000, P = 0.024). CONCLUSION The differentially expressed circulatory plasma miR-425-5p, miR-1180-3p, miR-122-5p, miR-24-3p and miR-4632-5p can be regarded as a new potential biomarker panel for the diagnosis of EGC. The prediction and early diagnosis of EGC can be considerably facilitated by combining gastroscopy with the use of these miRNA biomarkers, thereby optimizing the strategy for effective detection of EGC.

However, among EGCs classified according to Kodama's criteria, Pen A subgroup is characterized by extensive submucosal invasion, lymph node metastases and worse prognosis, whereas Pen B subgroup by better prognosis. The aim of the study was to characterize the differences between Pen A, Pen B and locally advanced gastric cancer (T3N0) in order to identify biomarkers involved in aggressiveness and clinical outcome. Methods We selected 33 Pen A, 34 Pen B and 20 T3N0 tumors and performed immunohistochemistry of mucins, copy number variation analysis of a gene panel, microsatellite instability (MSI), TP53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses. Results Pen A subgroup was characterized by MUC6 overexpression (p = 0.021). Otherwise, the Pen B subgroup was significantly associated with the amplification of GATA6 gene (p = 0.002). The higher percentage of MSI tumors was observed in T3N0 group (p = 0.002), but no significant differences between EGC types were found. Finally, TP53 gene analysis showed that 32.8% of Pen tumors have a mutation in exons 5-8 and 50.0% presented LOH. Co-occurrence of TP53 mutation and LOH mainly characterized Pen A tumors (p = 0.022). Conclusions Our analyses revealed that clinico-pathological parameters, microsatellite status and frequency of TP53 mutations do not seem to distinguish Pen subgroups.

Early gastric cancer, especially flat gastric cancer, lacks specific endoscopic features. Many cases appear to be similar to ordinary gastritis cases under normal white light endoscopy, which can lead to misdiagnosis. Aims In order to find a new method to improve detection rate of early gastric cancer in China, we designed a trial to validate linked color imaging (LCI) for screening of early gastric cancer in a high-risk population, as compared to white light imaging (WLI). Method Subjects were randomly allocated to either the LCI + WLI or WLI group and then subjected to gastroscopy and all endoscopies were made after special preparation. All endoscopists had knowledge of this experiment. The main indicator was the rate of detection of gastric neoplastic lesions. The difference in the detection rate between the two groups is reported. Results The detection rate was 4.31% in the WLI group and 8.01% in the LCI + WLI group. This is a difference of 3.70% with a P value < 0.001 and an OR (95% CI) of 1.934 (1.362, 2.746). The lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0, and the superiority margin was 1%.

Participant blood samples were taken for measure MIC-1, CA-199, CA72-4, and PG1/PG2 levels. The diagnostic performance of MIC-1 was assessed and compared with CA-199, CA72-4, and PG1/PG2, and its role in early GC diagnosis and the assessment of the risk of precancerous lesions have also been studied. Results Based on endoscopic and histopathological findings, 55 participants had GC, 566 participants had low-grade neoplasia, and 2605 participants had chronic gastritis. MIC-1 levels were significantly elevated in GC serum samples as compared to controls (P < .001). The sensitivity of serum MIC-1 for GC diagnosis was much higher than that of CA-199 (49.1% vs 20.0%) with similar specificities.

We aimed to examine urine proteomic signatures and identify protein biomarkers that predict the progression of gastric lesions and risk of GC. Methods A case-control study was initially designed, covering subjects with GC and gastric lesions of different stages. Subjects were aged 40-69 years, without prior diagnosis of renal or urological diseases. We enrolled a total of 255 subjects, with 123 in the discovery stage from Linqu, China, a high-risk area for GC and 132 in the validation stage from Linqu and Beijing. A prospective study was further designed for a subset of 60 subjects with gastric lesions, which were followed for 297-857 days. Findings We identified 43 differentially expressed urine proteins in subjects with GC vs. mild or advanced gastric lesions. Baseline urinary levels of ANXA11, CDC42, NAPA and SLC25A4 were further positively associated with risk of gastric lesion progression. Three of them, except for SLC25A4, also had higher expression in GC than non-GC tissues. Integrating these four proteins showed outstanding performance in predicting the progression of gastric lesions (AUC (95% CI): 0.92 (0.83-1.00)) and risk of GC (AUC (95% CI): 0.81 (0.73-0.89) and 0.84 (0.77-0.92) for GC vs. mild or advanced gastric lesions respectively). Interpretation This study revealed distinct urine proteomic profiles and a panel of proteins that may predict the progression of gastric lesions and risk of GC. These biomarkers in a non-invasive approach may have translational significance for defining high-risk populations of GC and its early detection. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

However, differentiating EGC from gastritis remains challenging. Although magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging (ME-NBI) is useful for differentiating EGC from gastritis, this skill takes substantial effort. Since the development of the ability to convolve the image while maintaining the characteristics of the input image (convolution neural network: CNN), allowing the classification of the input image (CNN system), the image recognition ability of CNN has dramatically improved. Aims To explore the diagnostic ability of the CNN system with ME-NBI for differentiating between EGC and gastritis. Methods A 22-layer CNN system was pre-trained using 1492 EGC and 1078 gastritis images from ME-NBI. A separate test data set (151 EGC and 107 gastritis images based on ME-NBI) was used to evaluate the diagnostic ability [accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)] of the CNN system. Results The accuracy of the CNN system with ME-NBI images was 85.3%, with 220 of the 258 images being correctly diagnosed. The method's sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 95.4%, 71.0%, 82.3%, and 91.7%, respectively. Seven of the 151 EGC images were recognized as gastritis, whereas 31 of the 107 gastritis images were recognized as EGC. The overall test speed was 51.83 images/s (0.02 s/image).

Plasma exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been suggested as novel biomarkers for GC. AIM To identify a novel biomarker for early detection of GC. METHODS Healthy donors (HDs) and GC patients diagnosed by pathology were recruited. Nine GC patients and three HDs were selected for exosomal whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing. The expression profiles of circRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics methods and validated by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels and area under receiver operating characteristic curve values of plasma exosomal circRNAs and standard serum biomarkers were used to compare their diagnostic efficiency. RESULTS There were 303 participants, including 240 GC patients and 63 HDs, involved in the study. The expression levels of exosomal hsa_circ_0079439 were significantly higher in GC patients than in HDs (P < 0.0001). However, the levels of standard serum biomarkers were similar between the two groups. The area under the curve value of exosomal hsa_circ_0079439 was higher than those of standard biomarkers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9, CA72-4, alpha-fetoprotein, and CA125 (0.8595 vs 0.5862, 0.5660, 0.5360, 0.5082, and 0.5018, respectively). The expression levels of exosomal hsa_circ_0079439 were significantly decreased after treatment (P < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of exosomal hsa_circ_0079439 were obviously higher in early GC (EGC) patients than in HDs (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Our results suggest that plasma exosomal hsa_circ_0079439 is upregulated in GC patients. Moreover, the levels of exosomal hsa_circ_0079439 could distinguish EGC and advanced GC patients from HDs. Therefore, plasma exosomal hsa_circ_0079439 might be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of GC during both the early and late stages.",2023/6/14,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:53,,3482-3496,,22,29,,World J.

This study aimed to construct a prediction nomogram based on a questionnaire to assess the risk of developing GC.Methods Our study comprised a total of 4379 participants (2326 participants from outpatient at Fengqing People's Hospital were considered for model development and internal validation, and 2053 participants from outpatients at the endoscopy center at the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University were considered for independent external validation) and gastric mucosa status was determined by endoscopy and biopsies. The eligible participants in development cohort from Fengqing people's Hospital were randomly separated into a training cohort (n=1629, 70.0%) and an internal validation cohort (n=697, 30.0%). The relevant features were selected by a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and the ensuing features were evaluated through multivariable logistic regression analysis. Subsequently, the variables were selected to construct a prediction nomogram. The discriminative ability and predictive accuracy of the nomogram were evaluated by the C-index and calibration plot, respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) curves were used for the assessment of clinical benefit of the model. This model was developed to estimate the risk of developing neoplastic lesions according to the ""transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis"" (TRIPOD) statement.Results Six variables, including age, sex, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, education level, and Hp infection status, were independent risk factors for the development of neoplastic lesions. Thus, these variables were incorporated into the final nomogram. The AUC of the nomogram were 0.701, 0.657 and 0.699 in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curve showed that the nomogram was in good agreement with the observed outcomes.

Accordingly, efforts are still required to lower the mortality rate of gastric cancer in Japan. Maebashi City introduced endoscopic gastric cancer screening in 2004, and participants are able to choose between direct radiography and endoscopy. Hence, we expected to see a decrease in mortality rate from gastric cancer after introducing endoscopic screening and a difference in mortality rate reduction between screening methods. AIM To evaluate the impact on gastric cancer mortality rate of two types of gastric cancer screening in Maebashi City, Japan. METHODS Participants aged 40 to 79 years of the Maebashi City gastric cancer screening program in 2006 who were screened by direct radiography (n = 11155) or endoscopy (n = 10747) were included. Participants were followed until March 31, 2012, by cross-referencing their data against the Gunma Prefecture cancer registry data. We compared the detection rate of gastric cancers. Then, we compared the mortality rate between the two groups. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of gastric cancer death. Finally, the reduction in gastric cancer mortality rate associated with each screening method was evaluated. RESULTS Gastric cancer was detected in 22 participants undergoing direct radiography (detection rate, 0.20%) and in 52 participants undergoing endoscopy (detection rate, 0.48%). However, most gastric cancers detected by endoscopic screening were early cancers that may not have resulted in death. We found no significant difference in gastric cancer mortality rate between participants receiving annual screening and those who do not. When the number of gastric cancer deaths in the direct radiography group was set as 1 in the Cox proportional hazard analysis, the HR of gastric cancer death was 1.368 (95%CI: 0.7308-2.562) in the overall group of participants. The results showed no significant difference between the two screening methods in any of the analysis groups. CONCLUSION Although endoscopic screening detected more gastric cancer than direct radiographic screening, no significant difference in the reduction of gastric cancer mortality rate between the two screening methods was found.",2021/9/7,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:58,,5595-5609,,33,27,,World J.

Methods We recruited biopsies of a total of 84 subjects including 72 primary tumor biopsies from histopathologically proven gastric carcinoma, 8 adjacent controls and 12 independent controls. We used gastric cancer cell line, AGS, for validation of our data. Expression profiling at transcript level was done by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and at proteome level by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Receiver operator characteristics analysis was done for determining the diagnostic utility of p27 and p16 with respect to the sensitivity and specificity. Results We demonstrate that p27 and p16 are frequently over expressed in early stages of gastric carcinoma.

However, it has markedly advanced recently. The improvement of the diagnostic ability is expected. AIM To compare the early gastric cancer diagnostic ability of an ultrathin endoscope loaded with a laser light source and that of the conventional endoscope. METHODS The target subjects were 375 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopy at our hospital for post-endoscopic submucosal dissection follow-up of gastric cancer from January to August 2018. During endoscopy, the ultra thin endoscope was used in 140 patients (37.3%), and the conventional endoscope was used in 235 patients (62.7%). Patient background was adjusted using the propensity score matching method, and gastric cancer detection ability was evaluated in the two groups. RESULTS The gastric cancer detection rate was 7.8% in the ultrathin endoscope group and 7.0% in the conventional endoscope group, and the mean intragastric observation time was 4.1 +/- 1.7 min in the ultrathin endoscope group and 4.1 +/- 1.9 min in the conventional endoscope group, showing no significant differences between the groups. Moreover, the biopsy implementation rate was 31.8% in the ultrathin endoscope group and 41.1% in the conventional endoscope group, and the biopsy prediction rate was 17.9% and 13.2%, respectively, showing no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSION The gastric cancer diagnostic ability of the ultrathin endoscope loaded with a laser light source was comparable to that of the conventional endoscope.

We developed a model to determine the invasion depth of EGCs using conventional endoscopy and EUS findings, with pathology results as the reference. Methods We performed a retrospective study of 195 patients (205 lesions) diagnosed with gastric cancers who underwent endoscopy and EUS followed by resection. Based on pathology analyses, lesions (n = 205) were assigned to categories of: mucosa invasion or minute invasion into the submucosal layer less than 500 mu m from the muscularis mucosae (M-SM1) or penetration of 500 mu m or more (>= SM2). The lesions were randomly assigned to derivation (138 lesions) and validation sets (67 lesions). A depth predictive model was proposed in the derivation set using multivariate logistic regression analyses. The discriminative power of this model was assessed in both sets. Results Remarkable redness (OR 5.42; 95% CI 1.32-22.29), abrupt cutting of converging folds (OR 8.58; 95% CI 1.65-44.72), lesions location in the upper third of the stomach (OR 10.26; 95% CI 2.19-48.09), and deep invasion based on EUS findings (OR 16.53; 95% CI 4.48-61.15) significantly associated with >= SM2 invasion. A model that incorporated these 4 variables discriminated between M-SM1 and >= SM2 lesions with the area under the ROC curve of 0.865 in the derivation set and 0.797 in the validation set. In the derivation set, a cut-off score of 8 identified lesions as >= SM2 with 54% sensitivity and 97% specificity. The model correctly predicted the invasion depth 89.86% of lesions; it overestimated the depth of 2.17% of lesions. Conclusions We developed a model to identify EGCs with invasion depth >= SM2 based on endoscopy and EUS findings. This model might reduce overestimation of gastric tumor depth and prevent unnecessary gastrectomy.",Feb-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,855-863,,2,32,,Surg.

Sedation could improve patient cooperation and quality of endoscopy. However, sedation is still not very popular in some resource-limited countries and regions. The purpose of this study was to compare propofol-based sedated versus un-sedated CLE in the value of diagnosing early gastric cancer (EGC) and precancerous lesions. Methods A retrospective, cohort, single center study of 226 patients who underwent CLE between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 was performed. Patients enrolled were allocated into the propofol-based sedated group (n = 126) and the un-sedated group (n = 100). The comparison of validity and reliability of CLE for identifying EGC and precancerous lesions between the two groups was performed through analyzing CLE diagnosis and pathological diagnosis. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. Results The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of diagnosing EGC in the sedated group was 0.97 (95 % CI: 0.95 to 0.99), which was higher than that in the un-sedated group (0.88 (95 % CI: 0.80 to 0.97), P = 0.0407). CLE with sedation performed better than without sedation in diagnosing intraepithelial neoplasia and intestinal metaplasia (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.0001, respectively). For patients considered as high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or EGC by endoscopists, they would not get biopsy during CLE but receive endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) subsequently, and the misdiagnosis rate of CLE was 0 % in the sedated group and 27.59 % (95 % CI: 10.30-44.91 %) in the un-sedated group (P = 0.006). Conclusions Propofol based sedation was associated with improved diagnostic value of CLE for detecting EGC as well as precancerous lesions (intraepithelial neoplasia OR intestinal metaplasia).",2021/3/30,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:00,,97,,1,21,,BMC Anesthesiol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 7 Place: London Publisher: BMC Web of Science ID: WOS:000636225400002,,,,Early gastric cancer; Precancerous lesions; QUALITY; CLASSIFICATION; Confocal laser endomicroscopy; GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY; NEOPLASIA; based sedation; Propofol&#8208; 477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective Our objective is to use a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic performance of circulating miRNAs in gastric cancer. Methods We reviewed databases and methodically obtained papers for analysis until October 15th, 2021. The random-effect meta-analysis was performed to construct pooled diagnostic parameters. To detect the causes of heterogeneity, spearman threshold effect analysis and subgroup analysis were performed. The I-2 and Chi-square tests were also used to examine the heterogeneity. The subgroup analyses were conducted based on sample types (serum/plasma/blood), normalized genes (U6, miR-16, and miR-39), qPCR mastermix (SYBR and Taqman), and country. Finally, the publication bias was estimated using Egger's funnel plot asymmetry test. Results A total of 40 articles covering 73 studies (59 microRNAs) were included, containing 11,022 participants (6,324 cases and 4,698 controls). The overall pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.74-0.77), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.78-0.80), 4.081 (95% CI: 3.43-4.85), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.25-0.32), 16.08 (95% CI: 12.34-20.95), and 0.877 (CI: 0.84-0.90), respectively. We conducted a subgroup analysis of diagnostic values, which revealed that serum type, U6 reference gene, SYBR mastermix, and East Asian Countries (China and Japan) had better diagnostic value.

Aims The study aims to identify more authentic circRNA expression profiles that could function as potential biomarkers in GC. Methods circRNA expression data in three microarrays were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. A systematic meta-analysis based on an integrated dataset pre-processed from the three microarrays was conducted to identify a panel of differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircs) by using the metaDE package. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes term enrichment were used to note the corresponding functions of DEcircs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to verify the DEcircs expression in cancer tissues and adjacent paracancerous tissues. A GC risk-related circRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs network was further constructed and analyzed. Results MetaDE analysis suggested 64 DEcircs between cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. GO and KEGG analysis showed that the parental genes of these DEcircs were mainly associated with histone methylation, Wnt signalosome and histone methylation activity.

Methods Hsa_circ_0086720 was detected in GC cell lines, tissues, and plasma, and the clinicopathological correlations were investigated. The existence, stability, origin, and change in the plasma hsa_circ_0086720 level were verified in early GC patients.

Accumulating evidences have elucidated that circRNAs play essential roles in the pathogenesis of diseases including cancers. Exosomal circRNAs are those circRNAs stably existing in exosomes and having high clinical values as novel potential diagnostic biomarkers of many diseases. Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, including pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and gastric cancer, are leading causes of mortality worldwide and a major global health burden. However, no ideal tumor biomarkers of screening early GI cancers are currently available. Methods We collected data through Web of Science.

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of biomarkers and relative regulatory targets. The lipidomic analysis of the samples from platinum-resistant in gastric cancer patients is expected to help us further improve our understanding of it. Methods We employed LC-MS based untargeted lipidomic analysis to search for potential candidate biomarkers for platinum resistance in GC patients. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and variable importance in projection (VIP) analysis were used to identify differential lipids. The possible molecular mechanisms and targets were obtained by metabolite set enrichment analysis and potential gene network screened. Finally, verified them by immunohistochemical of a tissue microarray. Results There were 71 differential lipid metabolites identified in GC samples between the chemotherapy-sensitivity group and the chemotherapy resistance group. According to Foldchange (FC) value, VIP value, P values (FC > 2, VIP > 1.5, p < 0.05), a total of 15 potential biomarkers were obtained, including MGDG(43:11)-H, Cer(d18:1/24:0) + HCOO, PI(18:0/18:1)-H, PE(16:1/18:1)-H, PE(36:2) + H, PE(34:2p)-H, Cer(d18:1 + hO/24:0) + HCOO, Cer(d18:1/23:0) + HCOO, PC(34:2e) + H, SM(d34:0) + H, LPC(18:2) + HCOO, PI(18:1/22:5)-H, PG(18:1/18:1)-H, Cer(d18:1/24:0) + H and PC(35:2) + H. Furthermore, we obtained five potential key targets (PLA2G4A, PLA2G3, DGKA, ACHE, and CHKA), and a metabolite-reaction-enzyme-gene interaction network was built to reveal the biological process of how they could disorder the endogenous lipid profile of platinum resistance in GC patients through the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. Finally, we further identified PLA2G4A and ACHE as core targets of the process by correlation analysis and tissue microarray immunohistochemical verification. Conclusion PLA2G4A and ACHE regulated endogenous lipid profile in the platinum resistance in GC patients through the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. The screening of lipid biomarkers will facilitate earlier precision medicine interventions for chemotherapy-resistant gastric cancer.

Some patients are diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by antigen tests or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19, even if they have no symptoms, such as fever or respiratory symptoms. We herein describe a patient with gastric cancer who underwent distal gastrectomy 6 weeks after recovering from COVID-19 infection diagnosed by preoperative PCR. Case presentation An 86-year-old man was transferred to our hospital because of hematemesis and melena. A hemorrhagic gastric ulcer was found in the lesser curvature of the antrum by emergency endoscopy. Endoscopic hemostasis was performed, and he was discharged after recovery. A tumor-like lesion in the lesser curvature of the antrum was found on repeat endoscopy and was diagnosed as well-differentiated adenocarcinoma by biopsy. There was no evidence of lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis; therefore, we planned radical surgery. However, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by preoperative PCR screening. Although he had no symptoms, such as fever or respiratory symptoms, he was hospitalized because of his advanced age. He was discharged 10 days after admission, and repeat COVID-19 PCR was negative. We planned radical surgery for the stomach tumor 6 weeks after recovery from the COVID-19 infection. A PCR-negative COVID-19 status was confirmed again before hospitalization. Open distal gastrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction was performed. We avoided ultrasonic scalpels and used a Crystal Vision 450D surgical smoke evacuator (I.C. Medical, Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA) to reduce intraoperative surgical smoke. The postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some patients are diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by preoperative antigen tests or PCR, even if they have no symptoms. If possible, elective surgery should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after recovery from COVID-19 infection to maximize safety. Moreover, surgeons must consider intraoperative surgical smoke.",2022/1/17,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,12,,1,8,,SURG.

Patients and methods: Between 2003 and 2011, 1497 consecutive patients with 1539 differentiated-type early gastric cancers meeting absolute or expanded indication criteria underwent curative ESD. They were followed up with esophago-gastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) under a standardized surveillance protocol. Long-term outcomes were analyzed for 1306 patients with at least 1 year's follow-up. Results: Incidences of residual and synchronous lesions detected within 1 year were 0.13% and 0.87 %, respectively. During median 47 months of follow-up, there was 1 local recurrence (0.08 %; early gastric cancer) and 47 cases of metachronous recurrence (3.6 %; 44 early gastric cancers, 3 pT2 advanced gastric cancers); all were curatively treated. During a 5-year surveillance, the cumulative incidence curve of metachronous recurrence increased linearly. Median time from ESD to metachronous recurrence was 30 months. There were 2 extragastric recurrences (0.15 %) in lymph nodes, at 5 and 4 years, respectively, after curative ESD for absolute and expanded indications. The patient with the expanded indications underwent a palliative operation and died of gastric cancer progression. Conclusions: There was a constant incidence rate of metachronous recurrence during a 5-year surveillance period and there was extragastric recurrence at least 4 years after ESD of early gastric cancer even for absolute indications. Therefore, annual or biannual surveillance EGD and abdominal CT might be necessary for at least 5 years after curative ESD for early gastric cancers, with absolute as well as expanded indications.",Sep-15,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:14,,784-793,,9,47,,Endoscopy,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: Stuttgart Publisher: Georg Thieme Verlag Kg Web of Science ID: WOS:000360273400004,,,,RISK; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI; RESECTION; MARKER; ERADICATION; LYMPH-NODE METASTASIS; STOMACH; MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY; LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; 987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to assess the impact, with regard to earlier diagnosis of oesophageal and gastric cancer, of the first 10 years of a regional open-access endoscopy service in the Dumfries and Galloway region of Scotland. Patients and Methods: Data were retrieved from prospectively compiled endoscopy and cancer registry databases. Route of referral (open-access vs. outpatient vs. inpatient), presenting symptoms (alarm vs. benign) and UICC disease stage in consecutive 5-year periods (1994-1998 and 1999-2003) were compared. Results: 386 oesophagogastric cancers were identified (179 during 1994-1998 and 207 in 1999-2003). The number of patients undergoing endoscopy increased from 500 per annum prior to the open-access service to 7359 during 1994-1998 and 9701 in 1999-2003.

Digital images of cells magnified 1000-fold appear in real time on a computer screen, which enables immediate detection of changes in cellular structure without the need for a biopsy. The aim of this study was to assess the features of the cellular architecture of cancerous tissue that can be used in the differential diagnosis of cancerous tissue and normal mucosa using this system's image-processing software. Patients and methods: A total of 27 gastric cancers were examined ex vivo using confocal endomicroscopy. A fluorescent contrast agent, acriflavine, was applied topically to normal and to cancerous mucosa. In vivo imaging of the gastric mucosa after intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium was also performed in nine patients with gastritis or gastric cancer. Results: The nuclear area in the ex vivo specimens was calculated using Scion Image software. The mean nuclear area of cancer cells was found to be significantly larger than that of normal cells in 18/27 gastric cancers (67%). The mean nuclear area of the cancers tended to be larger than that of normal mucosa, especially in cases of differentiated adenocarcinoma. In more than half the cases, it was possible to diagnose malignancy automatically using confocal endomicroscopy and image-processing software without the need for biopsy and pathological examination. In vivo imaging of cancerous lesions showed irregularity in cellularity and vascularity.

However, evaluation of irregular microvascular patterns is subjective and is often difficult, even with expert eyes. The aim of this study was to clarify the most important microvascular patterns in magnifying NBI for diagnosis of EGC.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of a multicenter prospective trial among nine Japanese hospitals. A total of 1353 patients underwent screening with white-light endoscopy and 362 patients had small (≤ depressed lesions. They were randomly assigned to magnifying NBI or white-light endoscopy followed by magnifying NBI. During diagnosis, magnifying NBI images were recorded before biopsy. All magnifying NBI images were reviewed and evaluated for the association of four features of microvessels - that is, dilation, tortuosity, difference in caliber, and variation in shape - with cancer diagnosis.; RESULTS: Images of 343 lesions (40 cancerous and 303 benign depression lesions) were evaluable. The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity) of each finding was: dilation, 25/90 ortuosity, 55/24 ifference in caliber, 13 nd variation in shape, 70/95 ultivariate analysis identified only variation in shape as being statistically significantly associated with diagnosis of cancer (odds ratio 38.0, 95 nfidence interval: 16.1 , P 1).

The aim of this study was to investigate the improvement in diagnostic accuracy for tumor delineation obtained with different magnification levels of ME-NBI following CE. Patients and methods: This was a retrospective study, performed at a single tertiary referral center. A series of 158 consecutive patients with 161 early gastric cancers resected en bloc using ESD was included in the study. The margins of each lesion were examined in their entirety using CE, followed by low power optical magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (LM-NBI), and finally the highest power optical magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (HM-NBI). The primary endpoint was the added benefit, as measured using the successful delineation rate, for the delineation of gastric cancer margins using CE + LM-NBI vs CE, and for CE + LM-NBI + HM-NBI vs CE + LM-NBI. Results: The successful delineation rates (95 % CI) using CE, CE + LM-NBI and CE + LM-NBI + HM-NBI were 72.7 % (68.5-79.9 %), 88.9 % (84.2-93.8 %), and 98.1 % (95.8-100 %).

We investigated the efficacy of LCI and BLI-bright compared to conventional white light imaging (WLI) by measuring the color difference between early gastric cancer lesions and the surrounding mucosa.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Images of early gastric cancer scheduled for endoscopic submucosal dissection were captured by LCI, BLI-bright, and WLI under the same conditions. Color values of the lesion and surrounding mucosa were defined as the average of the color value in each region of interest. Color differences between the lesion and surrounding mucosa (DeltaE) were examined in each mode. The color value was assessed using the CIE L*a*b* color space (CIE: Commission Internationale d'Eclairage).; RESULTS: We collected images of 43 lesions from 42 patients. Average DeltaE values with LCI, BLI-bright, and WLI were 11.02, 5.04, and 5.99, respectively. The DeltaE was significantly higher with LCI than with WLI ( P 1). Limited to cases of small DeltaE with WLI, the DeltaE was approximately 3 times higher with LCI than with WLI (7.18 vs. 2.25). The DeltaE with LCI was larger when the surrounding mucosa had severe intestinal metaplasia ( P ). The average color value of a lesion and the surrounding mucosa differed.

In this study, the monoclonal antibody MG7, which is a specific molecular marker against gastric cancer, was labeled with fluorescent agents to enable in vivo real-time imaging by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE). Patients and methods: In vivo molecular imaging was performed in tumor-bearing mice from two kinds of human gastric cancer cell lines. Xenograft tumors were visualized in vivo first with a whole-body fluorescent imaging device and then by CLE using fluorescently labeled MG7 antibody. Gastric cancerous tissue and noncancerous mucosa from human biopsies or surgical specimens were also examined ex vivo by CLE. Results: Intravital imaging of xenograft tumors revealed a specific cellular signal, whereas no specific signal was observed in control tissue or in mice injected with irrelevant antibodies. An ex vivo experiment on human specimens using a rigid confocal probe showed positive fluorescent staining in 22/23 samples diagnosed as gastric cancer and weak signals in 5/23 noncancerous tissue samples.

The current study aimed to clarify the efficacy of IEE using advanced diagnostic endoscopy for EGC detection without magnification.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed endoscopic examinations without magnification in patients referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal tumor detected through routine screening endoscopy. In this study, we used three IEE technologies: narrow-band imaging; blue laser imaging; and i-scan optical enhancement. The detection rates for EGC between IEE and white-light imaging (WLI) were compared.; RESULTS: Between July 2013 and June 2014, 156 patients were enrolled. Among upper gastrointestinal tumors, we analyzed endoscopic examination results of 119 lesions that were histologically diagnosed as EGC in 109 patients. The EGC detection rate in the IEE plus WLI groups was 77.3 lthough the EGC detection rate in the IEE group was higher than that in the WLI group (80.0 . 70.3 there was no significant difference between these two modalities. An important detection factor using IEE was tumor circumference, where the rate of detection in the anterior wall and lesser curvature was significantly higher than that in the posterior wall and greater curvature ( P 6).

However, whether autofluorescent diagnosis could be genuinely useful in screening for gastric neoplasms has not been well investigated in clinical practice. Accordingly, we retrospectively studied our experience with this diagnostic technique for various gastric lesions and assessed its diagnostic utility. Patients and Methods: Autofluorescence diagnosis of 109 gastric lesions in 79 patients was done, without knowledge of the diagnosis by conventional white light endoscopy, retrospectively and independently by three endoscopists with 6 years', two years' and no experience of the technique. After examination of the interobserver bias in the assessment of autofluorescent pseudocolor in light-induced fluorescence endoscopy (LIFE), the relationship between pseudocolor and characteristics of gastric lesions (including histology, macroscopic type, and depth of invasion) were investigated. Results: The kappa statistic for agreement in pseudocolor diagnosis between the three endoscopists was 0.71. The assessment of pseudocolor by all of the observers was in agreement in 67 of the total of 109 lesions (61.5%). Experience with the LIFE technique did not improve the accuracy of pseudocolor determination. All of the cancers, 87.5% of the adenomas, and 50.9% of the benign lesions were recognized as having an abnormal autofluorescent image. None of the gastric cancers and 49.1% of the benign lesions were evaluated as having a normal autofluorescence image. The histopathological and macroscopic types of tumors and their depths of invasion were not reflected in the autofluorescence diagnosis. Conclusions: LIFE provided a sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 49.1%, suggesting that this technique has limited clinical utility, regardless of the merits of acceptable interobserver bias and lack of necessity for experience with this technique.",Jun-04,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:20,,515-521,,6,36,,Endoscopy,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 7 Place: Stuttgart Publisher: Georg Thieme Verlag Kg Web of Science ID: WOS:000221996200005,,,,CANCER; DYSPLASIA; TISSUE; MUCOSA; SPECTROSCOPY; AUTOFLUORESCENCE ENDOSCOPY; LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; 1238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to construct a deep learning (DL) model based on magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) to evaluate OLGIM staging. Methods: This study included 4473 ME-NBI images obtained from 803 patients at three endoscopy centres. The endoscopic expert marked intestinal metaplasia (IM) regions on endoscopic images of the target biopsy sites. Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network model was used to grade IM lesions and predict OLGIM staging. Results: The diagnostic performance of the model for IM grading in internal and external validation sets, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC), was 0.872 and 0.803, respectively. The accuracy of this model in predicting the high-risk stage of OLGIM was 84.0%, which was not statistically different from that of three junior (71.3%, p = 0.148) and three senior endoscopists (75.3%, p = 0.317) specially trained in endoscopic images corresponding to pathological IM grade, but higher than that of three untrained junior endoscopists (64.0%, p = 0.023). Conclusion: This DL model can assist endoscopists in predicting OLGIM staging using ME-NBI without biopsy, thereby facilitating screening high-risk patients for GC.

In this study, we aim to provide an updated and precise cost estimation for esophageal cancer screening based on a randomized controlled trial in a high-risk area in China.MethodsWe estimated the cost of esophageal cancer screening with chromoendoscopy using a micro-costing approach based on primary data of the ESECC (Endoscopic Screening for Esophageal Cancer in China) randomized controlled trial (NCT01688908) from a health sector perspective. Unit costs and quantities of resources were collected to obtain annual screening costs. The screening project was then theoretically expanded to a 10-year period to explore long-term trends of costs. Costs were adjusted to US dollars for the year 2018.ResultsIn the ESECC trial, screening cost per endoscopy with a valid pathologic diagnosis was $196, accounting for 3.82% of the gross domestic product per capita in Hua County, and the costs for detecting one esophageal cancer and one early-stage esophageal cancer were $26,347 and $37,687, respectively. In conventional screening in which protocol-driven costs were excluded, costs as above were $134, $18,074, and $25,853. The cost for detecting one gastric cardia cancer or stomach cancer was nine times higher than detecting one esophageal cancer owing to low prevalences of the two cancers. In a simulated 10-year screening project, annual cost decreased notably over time.ConclusionsDespite the relatively low absolute cost, population-level endoscopic screening will still be a heavy burden on local government considering the socioeconomic conditions. Long-lasting programs would be less costly and population-level screening would make little sense in non-high-risk regions.",Jun-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:05,,819-827,,6,37,,Pharmacoeconomics,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 9 Place: Northcote Publisher: Adis Int Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000468881100006,,,,678,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to identify hub genes involved in the pathogenesis and prognosis of GC. Methods: We integrated five microarray datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GC and normal samples were analyzed with limma package. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed using DAVID. Then we established the protein protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database (STRING). The prognostic analysis of hub genes were performed through Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). Additionally, we used real-time quantitative PCR to validate the expression of hub genes in 5 pairs of tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues. Finally, the candidate small molecules as potential drugs to treat GC were predicted in CMap database. Results: Through integrating five microarray datasets, a total of 172 overlap DEGs were detected including 79 up-regulated and 93 down-regulated genes. Biological process analysis of functional enrichment showed these DEGs were mainly enriched in digestion, collagen fibril organization and cell adhesion. Signaling pathway analysis indicated that these DEGs played an vital in ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. Protein-protein interaction network among the overlap DEGs was established with 124 nodes and 365 interactions. Three DEGs with high degree of connectivity (NID2, COL4A1 and COL4A2) were selected as hub genes. The GEPIA database confirmed that overexpression levels of hub genes were significantly associated with worse survival of patients. Finally, the 20 most significant small molecules were obtained based on CMap database and spiradoline was the most promising small molecule to reverse the GC gene expression. Conclusions: Our results indicated that NID2, COL4A1 and COL4A2 could be the potential novel biomarkers for GC diagnosis prognosis and the promising therapeutic targets. The present study may be crucial to understanding the molecular mechanism of GC initiation and progression.",May-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:05,,1038-1048,,5,215,,Pathol. Res.

Chromoendoscopy (CH) is an image-enhanced video endoscopy technique, which is used for inspection of the gastrointestinal-tract by spraying dyes to highlight the gastric mucosal structures. An endoscopy session can end up with generating a large number of video frames. Therefore, inspection of every individual endoscopic-frame is an exhaustive task for the medical experts. In contrast with manual inspection, the automated analysis of gastroenterology images using computer vision based techniques can provide assistance to endoscopist, by finding out abnormal frames from the whole endoscopic sequence. Methods: In this paper, we have presented a new feature extraction method named as Gabor-based gray-level co-occurrence matrix (G2LCM) for computer-aided detection of CH abnormal frames. It is a hybrid texture extraction approach which extracts a combination both local and global texture descriptors. Moreover, texture information of a CH image is represented by computing the gray level co-occurrence matrix of Gabor filters responses. Furthermore, the second-order statistics of these co-occurrence matrices are computed to represent images' texture. Results: The obtained results show the possibility to correctly classifying abnormal from normal frames, with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve as 91%, 82%, 87% and 0.91 respectively, by using a support vector machine classifier and G2LCM texture features. Conclusion: It is apparent from results that the proposed system can be used for providing aid to the gastroenterologist in the screening of the gastric tract. Ultimately, the time taken by an endoscopic procedure will be sufficiently reduced. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Apr-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,39-47,,,157,,Comput. Meth.

Hence, this study proposed an automatic segmentation framework: co-spatial attention and channel attention based triple-branch ResUnet (CSA-CA-TB-ResUnet) to achieve accurate segmentation of EGC lesions for aiding clinical diagnosis and treatment.Methods: The input gastroscopic image sequences of the triple-branch segmentation network CSA-CA-TB-ResUnet is firstly generated by the designed multi-branch input preprocessing (MBIP) module in order to fully utilize massive correlation information among multiple gastroscopic images of the same a lesion. Then, the proposed CSA-CA-TB-ResUnet performs the segmentation of EGC lesion, in which the co-spatial attention (CSA) mechanism is designed to activate the spatial location of EGC lesions by leveraging on the correlations among multiple gastroscopic images of the same EGC lesion, and the channel attention (CA) mechanism is introduced to extract subtle discriminative features of EGC lesions by capturing the interdependencies between channel features. Finally, two gastroscopic images datasets from different di-gestive endoscopic centers in the southwest and northeast regions of China respectively were collected to validate the performances of proposed segmentation method.Results: The correlation information among gastroscopic images was confirmed to be able to improve the accuracy of EGC segmentation. On another unseen dataset, our EGC segmentation method achieves Jaccard similarity index (JSI) of 84.54% (95% confidence interval (CI), 83.49%-85.56%), threshold Jaccard index (TJI) of 81.73% (95% CI, 79.70%-83.61%), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 91.08% (95% CI, 90.40%-91.76%) and pixel-wise accuracy (PA) of 91.18% (95% CI, 90.43%-91.87%), which is superior to other state-of-the-art methods. Even on the challenging small lesions, the segmentation results of our CSA-CA-TB-ResUnet-based method are consistently and significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods. We also compared the segmentation result of our model with the diagnostic accuracy with junior/senior expert. The comparison results indicated that our model performed better than the junior expert.Conclusions: This study proposed a novel CSA-CA-TB-ResUnet-based EGC segmentation method and it has a potential for real-time application in improving EGC clinical diagnosis and minimally invasive surgery.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

In our study, we investigate the associations of serum miR-25 level with the clinicopathological characteristics, diagnosis and prognosis of GC patients. METHODS: Serum samples from 184 GC patients, 56 gastritis patients and 78 healthy controls were subjected to real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and the relationship between micR-25 level and cliniopathological characteristics including diagnosis and prognosis was explored. RESULTS: Compared with the gastritis and healthy patients, serum miR-25 level was significantly up-regulated in patients with GC. Using a cut-off of 0.042, the level of miR-25 was significantly increased in serum samples from cancer patients; Using this test cancer patients were identified with 67.3-69.4% sensitivity and 80.4%-81.0% specificity. High serum miR-25 level was significantly associated with depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and stage of disease. In univariate and multivariate analyses, miR-25 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS). Moreover, high serum miR-25 level was correlated with poor prognosis in patients subgroups stratified by tumor size, depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis. Serum miR-25 level was increased in both prominent serosal invasion group and lymph node metastasis group. Furthermore, stratified analysis showed that the TNM stage I-VI patients with high serum miR-25 level had poor prognosis than those with low serum miR-25 level.

Although deep learning methods have recently made tremendous progress in gland segmentation, they have not given satisfactory boundary and region segmentation results of adjacent glands. These glands usually have a large difference in glandular appearance, and the statistical distribution between the training and test sets in deep learning is inconsistent. These problems make networks not generalize well in the test dataset, bringing difficulties to gland segmentation and early cancer diagnosis. Methods: To address these problems, we propose a Variational Energy Network named VENet with a traditional variational energy L-v loss for gland segmentation of pathological images and early gastric cancer detection in whole slide images (WSIs). It effectively integrates the variational mathematical model and the data-adaptability of deep learning methods to balance boundary and region segmentation. Furthermore, it can effectively segment and classify glands in large-size WSIs with reliable nucleus width and nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio features. Results: The VENet was evaluated on the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation challenge (GlaS) dataset, the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Glands (CRAG) dataset, and the self-collected Nanfang Hospital dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieved excellent performance for GlaS Test A (object dice 0.9562, object F1 0.9271, object Hausdorff distance 73.13), GlaS Test B (object dice 94.95, object F1 95.60, object Hausdorff distance 59.63), and CRAG (object dice 95.08, object F1 92.94, object Hausdorff distance 28.01). For the Nanfang Hospital dataset, our method achieved a kappa of 0.78, an accuracy of 0.9, a sensitivity of 0.98, and a specificity of 0.80 on the classification task of test 69 WSIs. Conclusions: The experimental results show that the proposed model accurately predicts boundaries and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It can be applied to the early diagnosis of gastric cancer by detecting regions of high-grade gastric intraepithelial neoplasia in WSI, which can assist pathologists in analyzing large WSI and making accurate diagnostic decisions.",Jun-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/24 16:31,,108178,,108178,250,,Comput.

Histopathological examination of gastric cancer is the gold standard for the diagnosis of gastric cancer. However, computer-aided diagnostic techniques are challenging to evaluate due to the scarcity of publicly available gastric histopathology image datasets. Methods: In this paper, a noble publicly available Gastric Histopathology Sub-size Image Database (GasHisSDB) is published to identify classifiers' performance. Specifically, two types of data are included: normal and abnormal, with a total of 245,196 tissue case images. In order to prove that the methods of different periods in the field of image classification have discrepancies on GasHisSDB, we select a variety of classifiers for evaluation. Seven classical machine learning classifiers, three Convolutional Neural Network classifiers, and a novel transformerbased classifier are selected for testing on image classification tasks. Results: This study performed extensive experiments using traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to prove that the methods of different periods have discrepancies on GasHisSDB. Traditional machine learning achieved the best accuracy rate of 86.08% and a minimum of just 41.12%. The best accuracy of deep learning reached 96.47% and the lowest was 86.21%. Accuracy rates vary significantly across classifiers. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first publicly available gastric cancer histopathology dataset containing a large number of images for weakly supervised learning. We believe that GasHisSDB can attract researchers to explore new algorithms for the automated diagnosis of gastric cancer, which can help physicians and patients in the clinical setting.",Mar-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,105207,,105207,142,,Comput.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of PGLs detected by screening endoscopy in the high prevalence area of Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infection. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study enrolled consecutive subjects who were diagnosed with PGL by endoscopic screening in Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center, Seoul, Korea, between October 2003 and September 2013. The characteristics and outcome of screening-detected patients (screening group) were compared with consecutive subjects diagnosed with PGL in the outpatient clinic (outpatient group). ResultsOf the 105194 recipients of screening upper endoscopy, 52 (0.049%) were found to have PGL. The median age was 54.2years (range 23-79), and 65.4% were women. The proportion of PGL to gastric malignancy was 12.1% (52/429) overall, but >30% (25/73) in middle-aged (40-59) women. PGLs in the screening group were more likely to be mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (98.1% vs 60.0%, P<0.001) and treated with H.pylori eradication alone (90.0% vs 48.1%, P<0.001) than those in the outpatient group.

ConclusionsIn Korea, a high prevalence area of H.pylori infection, PGL seems more prevalent than in Western countries. Endoscopic screening may help to detect early stage H.pylori-positive mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.

In this study, using the GIF-XP290N, we evaluated whether endoscopic diagnosis (discrimination between benign and malignant) of gastric lesions is possible using nonmagnified narrow-band imaging (NBI) endoscopy. MethodsThe subjects were 255 consecutive patients who underwent screening of the gastrointestinal tract using new ultrathin transnasal endoscopy. Their average age was 65.211.4 years. The male-female ratio was 2.5:1. All cases were examined using conventional white-light imaging (WLI) and nonmagnified NBI. When a depressed lesion was detected in the stomach, it was examined using WLI, then NBI close examination (at about 3mm). We observed the mucosal structure of the lesion using close visualization with NBI. Concerning mucosal structural changes, we looked for a clear demarcation line between the lesion and the surrounding mucosa, and loss, irregularity, or nonuniformity of the lesion mucosal microsurface pattern. ResultsA total of 52 depressed lesions were examined. The histological diagnosis was cancer for 8 lesions, and noncancer for 44 lesions. WLI examination yielded a sensitivity of 50.0% (4/8), specificity of 63.6% (28/44), and accuracy 61.5% (32/52). On the other hand, NBI close examination yielded a sensitivity of 87.5% (7/8), specificity of 93.2% (41/44), and accuracy of 92.3% (48/52), significantly higher.

Most GI cancer deaths can be reduced by earlier detection and more appropriate medical treatment. Unlike the current ""gold standard"" techniques, non-invasive and highly sensitive screening tests are required for GI cancer diagnosis. Here, we explored the potential of metabolomics for GI cancer detection and the classification of tissue-of-origin, and even the prognosis management.MethodsPlasma samples from 37 gastric cancer (GC), 17 colon cancer (CC), and 27 non-cancer (NC) patients were prepared for metabolomics and lipidomics analysis by three MS-based platforms. Univariate, multivariate, and clustering analyses were used for selecting significant metabolic features. ROC curve analysis was based on a series of different binary classifications as well as the true-positive rate (sensitivity) and the false-positive rate (1-specificity).ResultsGI cancers exhibited obvious metabolic perturbation compared with benign diseases. The differentiated metabolites of gastric cancer (GC) and colon cancer (CC) were targeted to same pathways but with different degrees of cellular metabolism reprogramming. The cancer-specific metabolites distinguished the malignant and benign, and classified the cancer types. We also applied this test to before- and after-surgery samples, wherein surgical resection significantly altered the blood-metabolic patterns. There were 15 metabolites significantly altered in GC and CC patients who underwent surgical treatment, and partly returned to normal conditions.ConclusionBlood-based metabolomics analysis is an efficient strategy for GI cancer screening, especially for malignant and benign diagnoses. The cancer-specific metabolic patterns process the potential for classifying tissue-of-origin in multi-cancer screening. Besides, the circulating metabolites for prognosis management of GI cancer is a promising area of research.",2023/4/4,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,36,,4,19,,Metabolomics,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 15 Place: New York Publisher: Springer Web of Science ID: WOS:000962783400001,,,,Biomarker; Gastric cancer; COLORECTAL-CANCER; Surveillance; Early detection; Metabolomics; METABOLOMICS; ANNOTATION; BARIATRIC SURGERY; C-13; Circulating metabolites; Colon cancer; HALLMARKS; METABONOMICS; 228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the skill among endoscopists varies greatly. Here, we aim to develop a deep learning-based system named ENDOANGEL-LD (lesion detection) to assist in detecting all focal gastric lesions and predicting neoplasms by WLE. Methods: Endoscopic images were retrospectively obtained from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (RHWU) for the development, validation, and internal test of the system. Additional external tests were conducted in 5 other hospitals to evaluate the robustness. Stored videos from RHWU were used for assessing and comparing the performance of ENDOANGEL-LD with that of experts. Prospective consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy were enrolled from May 6, 2021 to August 2, 2021 in RHWU to assess clinical practice applicability. Results: Over 10,000 patients undergoing upper endoscopy were enrolled in this study. The sensitivities were 96.9% and 95.6% for detecting gastric lesions and 92.9% and 91.7% for diagnosing neoplasms in internal and external patients, respectively. In 100 videos, ENDOANGEL-LD achieved superior sensitivity and negative predictive value for detecting gastric neoplasms from that of experts (100% vs 85.5% +/- 3.4% [P = .003] and 100% vs 86.4% +/- 2.8% [P = .002], respectively). In 2010 prospective consecutive patients, ENDOANGEL-LD achieved a sensitivity of 92.8% for detecting gastric lesions with 3.04 +/- 3.04 false positives per gastroscopy and a sensitivity of 91.8% and specificity of 92.4% for diagnosing neoplasms. Conclusions: Our results show that ENDOANGEL-LD has great potential for assisting endoscopists in screening gastric lesions and suspicious neoplasms in clinical work.",Feb-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,269-+,,2,95,,Gastrointest.

Little is known about the progression from preclinical, indolent lesions to widely invasive, aggressive phenotypes. Gastroendoscopy often fails to detect early lesions, and risk-reducing/prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) is the only curative approach. We present an HDGC family with early-onset disease in which clinical and histologic findings provided insight into the understanding of different HDGC phenotypes. Methods: The proband was diagnosed at age 18 years with widely invasive, metastatic DGC. CDH1 genetic testing identified a pathogenic, germline CDH1 variant (c. 1901C>T, p.Ala634Val). Thirty family members were tested, and 15 CDH1 carriers were identified. Results: Six family members had PTG, with negative preoperative workup. The proband's 14-year-old sister is the youngest patient, reported to date, to have PTG after negative preoperative biopsy sampling. Intramucosal HDGC foci were detected in all PTG specimens (1-33). In contrast to the ""indolent"" phenotype of these foci, the aggressive DGC from the proband showed pleomorphic cells, absent E-cadherin expression, increased proliferation (Ki-67 index), and activation of oncogenic events (p53, pSrc and pStat3 overexpression). All family members had Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Cag-A-positive strains were detected in all specimens, except in the proband's sister. Conclusions: HDGC is a heterogeneous disease regarding clinical behavior, endoscopic findings, histopathologic features, and immunophenotypic/molecular profile. The presence of bizarre, pleomorphic cells in endoscopic biopsy specimens is suggestive of advanced disease and should prompt clinical intervention. The involvement of a full multi-disciplinary team is essential for the management of these patients.",Jun-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:07,,1566-1575,,6,87,,Gastrointest.

This study determines the association between intervals of prior gastroscopy and mortality in patients with gastric cancer. Methods: We identified 20,066 newly diagnosed patients with gastric cancer in the National Health Insurance Database of Taiwan between 2002 and 2007. After we excluded patients who had gastroscopies performed <= 6 months before the diagnosis of cancer, patients were matched into 3 cohorts according to the intervals of prior gastroscopy: 6 months to 2 years (<2 Y cohort), 2 to 5 years (2-5 Y cohort), and none within the previous 5 years (> 5 Y cohort). The 3 cohorts were matched for age, curative treatment for gastric cancer, Helicobacter pylori therapy, and propensity scores comprised of sex, comorbidities, and concomitant medication usage. The primary outcome is the hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality. Results: After matching, we identified 1286, 1286, and 5144 patients for the <2 Y, 2 to 5 Y, and > 5 Y cohorts. Compared with the > 5 Y cohort, the HR of all- cause mortality for the <2 Y and 2 to 5 Y cohorts was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.89; P < .001) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91; P < .001), respectively.

However, practical and readily available methods are lacking. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of acetic acid chromoendoscopy (AAC) for determining the extent of gastric IM. Methods: One hundred twenty-six participants were enrolled. The participants underwent screening EGD with 1.5% acetic acid instillation for the detection of acetowhite reaction. Subsequently, targeted biopsies were performed at the 5 standard intra-gastric locations of the updated Sydney system. The accuracy of AAC was calculated using the histology results as a reference. Two endoscopists, each of whom was blinded to the other's result, determined the presence or absence of acetowhite reaction. Results: The overall diagnostic accuracy of AAC was 89.0%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 77.6% and 94.4%, respectively. The specificity for the gastric body was > 94%. The proportion of extensive IM, a strong risk factor for gastric cancer, increased from 0.9% to 18.1% when AAC was used instead of conventional EGD alone (P <.001). Endoscopically determined atrophy had a negative effect on the diagnosis of AAC (odds ratio, 3.012; 95% confidence interval, 1.625-5.583). There was substantial inter-and intra-observer agreement. Conclusions: AAC is a valid and reproducible tool for determining the extent of gastric IM and may serve as a practical method of identifying populations at high risk of gastric cancer.

However, proficiency in diagnostic algorithms requires substantial expertise and experience. In this study, we aimed to develop a computer-aided diagnostic model for EGM (EGCM) to analyze and assist in the diagnosis of EGC under ME-NBI. Methods: A total of 1777 ME-NBI images from 295 cases were collected from 3 centers. These cases were randomly divided into a training cohort (n Z 170), an internal test cohort (ITC, n Z 73), and an external test cohort (ETC, n Z 52). EGCM based on VGG-19 architecture (Visual Geometry Group [VGG], Oxford University, Oxford, UK) with a single fully connected 2-classification layer was developed through fine-tuning and validated on all cohorts. Furthermore, we compared the model with 8 endoscopists with varying experience. Primary comparison measures included accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: EGCM acquired AUCs of.808 in the ITC and.813 in the ETC. Moreover, EGCM achieved similar predictive performance as the senior endoscopists (accuracy:.770 vs.755, P = .355; sensitivity:.792 vs.767, P = .183; specificity:.745 vs.742, P = .931) but better than the junior endoscopists (accuracy:.770 vs.728, P<.05). After referring to the results of EGCM, the average diagnostic ability of the endoscopists was significantly improved in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, PPV, and NPV (P<.05).

We developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist endoscopists in identifying and delineating EGCs. Methods: We retrospectively collected and randomly selected 66 EGC M-NBI images and 60 non-cancer M-NBI images into a training set and 61 EGC M-NBI images and 20 non-cancer M-NBI images into a test set. After preprocessing and partition, we determined 8 gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features for each partitioned 40 x 40 pixel block and calculated a coefficient of variation of 8 GLCM feature vectors. We then trained a support vector machine (SVMLv1) based on variation vectors from the training set and examined in the test set. Furthermore, we collected 2 determined P and Q GLCM feature vectors from cancerous image blocks containing irregular microvessels from the training set, and we trained another SVM (SVMLv2) to delineate cancerous blocks, which were compared with expert-delineated areas for area concordance. Results: The diagnostic performance revealed accuracy of 96.3%, precision (positive predictive value [PPV]) of 98.3%, recall (sensitivity) of 96.7%, and specificity of 95%, at a rate of 0.41 +/- 0.01 seconds per image.

However, its impact on the detection rate is unknown. Methods: We conducted an open-label, randomized, parallel (1:1:1), controlled trial in 6 hospitals in China. Pa-tients were recruited between February 14, 2022 and July 30, 2022. Eligible patients were aged >18 years and undergoing gastroscopy in outpatient departments. Participants were randomly assigned to the MIEE-only mode (o-MIEE) group, white-light endoscopy-only mode (o-WLE) group, and MIEE when necessary mode (n-MIEE) group (initial WLE followed by switching to another endoscope with MIEE if necessary). Biopsy sampling of suspicious lesions of the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum was performed. Primary and secondary aims were to compare detection rates and positive predictive value (PPV) of early cancer and precancerous lesions in these 3 modes, respectively. Results: A total of 5100 recruited patients were randomly assigned to the o-MIEE (n = 1700), o-WLE (n = 1700), and n-MIEE (n = 1700) groups. In the o-MIEE, o-WLE, and n-MIEE groups, 29 (1.51%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.16), 4 (.21%; 95% CI, .08-.54), and 8 (.43%; 95% CI, .22-.85) early cancers were found, respectively (P < .001). The PPV for early cancer was higher in the o-MIEE group compared with the o-WLE and n-MIEE groups (63.04%, 33.33%, and 38.1%, respectively; P = .062). The same trend was seen for precancerous lesions (36.67%, 10.00%, and 21.74%, respectively).

For patients with a germline CDH1 mutation, risk-reducing gastrectomy is recommended. However, for those delaying surgery or for families with no causative mutation identified, regular endoscopy is advised. This study aimed to determine the yield of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) foci in individuals with a CDH1 pathogenic variant compared with those without and how this varies with successive endoscopies. Methods: Patients fulfilling HDGC criteria were recruited to a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Endoscopy was performed according to a strict protocol with visual inspection followed by focal lesion and random biopsy sampling to detect foci of SRCC. Survival analysis determined progression to finding of SRCC according to CDH1 mutation status. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and 36-item Short Form Health Survey questionnaires assessed quality of life before surveillance and each endoscopy. Results: Eighty-five individuals fulfilling HDGC criteria underwent 201 endoscopies; 54 (63.5%) tested positive for CDH1 mutation. SRCC yield was 61.1% in CDH1 mutation carriers compared with 9.7% in noncarriers, and mutation-positive patients had a 10-fold risk of SRCC on endoscopy compared with those with no mutation detected (P < .0005). Yield of SRCC decreased substantially with subsequent endoscopies. Surveillance was associated with improved psychological health. Conclusions: SRCC foci are prevalent in CDH1 mutation carriers and can be detected at endoscopy using a standardized, multiple biopsy sampling protocol. Decreasing yield over time suggests that the frequency of endoscopy might be reduced. For patients with no CDH1 pathogenic variant detected, the cost-to-benefit ratio needs to be assessed in view of the low yield.",Feb-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,408-418,,2,87,,Gastrointest.

Expression of microRNA-203 (miR-203) has been reported to decrease in GC. In addition, overexpression of miR-203 inhibits grow of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. However, whether miR-203 affects cell migration and invasion of GC remains unclear. This study aimed to reveal the role of miR-203 on migration and invasion of GC, and its potential mechanisms. METHODS: Synthetic pre-miR-203 (miR-203), anti-miR-203 and scrambled negative control RNAs was transfected into the gastric cancer SGC7901 cells to generate miR-203 or anti-miR-203-transfected stable clones. The roles of miR-203 on cell invasion and motility were then analyzed by Transwell migration assay and Wound healing assay in vitro. Using siRNA to targeting ERK1/2, Slug, and E-cadherin or Slug cDNA transfection (to increase Slug expression) to examine the miR-203 signaling pathway. We also examined the efficacies of miR-203 or anti-miR-203 on peritoneal metastasis of SGC7901 cells in the nude mouse model. RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-203 inhibits SGC7901 cell invasion and motility, followed by decreased phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and Slug expression, as well as increased E-cadherin expression. Re-expression of Slug in miR-203/SGC7901cells decreased E-cadherin expression and restored the invasive phenotypes. Targeting E-cadherin in miR-203/SGC7901cells also restored the invasive phenotypes. Inhibition of miR-203 promotes SGC7901 cell invasion and motility, followed by increased phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and Slug expression, as well as decreased E-cadherin expression. Targeting ERK1/2 or Slug in antimiR-203/SGC7901cells increased E-cadherin expression and reversed the invasive phenotypes. In addition, targeting ERK1/2 decreased Slug and increased the E-cadherin expression. Significantly, we found that miR-203 could exert marked inhibition of the peritoneal metastasis of SGC7901 in nude mice in vivo. Targeting miR-203 could exert marked promotion of the peritoneal metastasis of SGC7901 in nude mice in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: miR-203/ERK1/2/Slug/E-cadherin signaling pathway plays an essential role on SGC7901 cell invasion and motility. miR-203 can be novel modalities to prevent peritoneal metastasis of invasive cancers such as gastric cancer.",2017,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:10,,11月20日,,1,19,,Cancer Biomark.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: Amsterdam Publisher: Ios Press Web of Science ID: WOS:000400998800002,,,,Gastric cancer; METASTASIS; ADENOCARCINOMA; BREAST-CANCER; PROSTATE-CANCER; PATHWAY; CARCINOMA; GROWTH; MIGRATION; invasion; EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; ADHESION SYSTEM; extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK); microRNA-203; slug; 849,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some Asian countries, screening EGD has greatly improved the survival rate. However, patients' discomfort and the need for sedation may limit adherence to screening programs. Previous studies have shown good tolerance and good agreement of magnetically controlled capsule gastroscopy (MCCG) with EGD. This study was designed to assess the application of MCCG in GC detection in an asymptomatic population. Methods: In this observational cohort study, 3182 asymptomatic individuals undergoing MCCG in 99 participating medical examination centers from April to December 2016 were enrolled. Patients with ulcers and suspected malignancies were referred for gastroscopy and biopsy. The detection rate of GC and focal lesions were used to explore the application of MCCG in asymptomatic individuals. Results: Seven patients (0.22%) were diagnosed with GC among the enrolled 3182 individuals, accounting for 0.74% (7/948) in patients over 50 years. No gender disparity was observed. EGD and biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma in all cases of suspected malignancy. Benign polyps, gastric ulcers, and submucosal tumors were found in 10.4%, 4.9%, and 3.6% of patients, respectively. There was a trend for the prevalence of focal lesions to increase with age. MCCG examination proved to be safe. Conclusions: MCCG can detect cancer and benign lesions and is safe and clinically feasible in a large population.

Little is known about clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features associated with FAP-related GC. We compared these features in FAP patients with and without GC. Methods: FAP patients were identified through the David G. Jagelman Inherited Colorectal Cancer Registries Cologene database. FAP patients with GC and randomly selected FAP patients without GC who had undergone at least 2 EGDs were analyzed. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features were compared. Results: Ten FAP patients with GC were identified, and 40 age-matched FAP control subjects were selected. No demographic differences were noted between patients and control subjects. All GC cases arose in the proximal stomach among gastric polyposis, with only 2 endoscopically visible. The prevalence of gastric polyposis was similar (100% vs 93%). Endoscopic features associated with GC included a carpeting of gastric polyps (100% vs 22.5%), solitary polyps > 20 mm (100% vs 0%), and a polypoid mound of polyps (80% vs 0%; all P <.001).

We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare GC detection rates between the BaEndo group, which underwent annual barium tests for primary screening followed by detailed endoscopic examinations, and the ABC -Endo group, where endoscopy intervals were determined based on individual gastric cancer risk in the ABC classification. Methods: In total, 1206 individuals from Yurihonjo and Nikaho City, Akita Prefecture, were randomized through the minimization method using sex and age as allocation factors. The intervention study was conducted for both groups over 5 years. The Ba-Endo group received annual barium tests, and the ABC -Endo group underwent EGD at different intervals: group A, EGD only at entry; group B, EGD once every 3 years; group C, EGD once every 2 years; and group D, EGD every year. Results: There were 24 detected GC lesions, with a GC detection rate of 1.9%. GC detection rates in the Ba-Endo and ABC -Endo groups were 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively, with no significant differences between groups (P = 1.0). However, the rate of GC cured by endoscopic resection alone was 41.6% in the Ba-Endo group and was significantly higher at 90.9% in the ABC -Endo group (P = .02). Conclusions: There were no differences between the Ba-Endo and ABC -Endo groups in GC detection rates.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the additive effect of linked color imaging (LCI) next to white-light endoscopy (WLE) for identification of EGC, when assessed by expert and non-expert endoscopists. Methods: Forty EGC cases were visualized in corresponding WLE and LCI images. Endoscopists evaluated the cases in 3 assessment phases: Phase 1: WLE images only; Phase 2: LCI images only; Phase 3: WLE and LCI images side-to-side. First, 3 expert endoscopists delineated all cases. A high level of agreement between the expert delineations corresponded with a high AND/OR ratio. Subsequently, 62 non-experts indicated their preferred biopsy location. Outcomes of the study are as follows: (1) difference in expert AND/OR ratio; (2) accuracy of biopsy placement by non-expert endoscopists; and (3) preference of imaging modality by non-expert endoscopists. Results: Quantitative agreement between experts increased significantly when LCI was available (0.58 vs. 0.46, p = 0.007). This increase was more apparent for the more challenging cases (0.21 vs. 0.47, p < 0.001). Non-experts placed the biopsy mark more accurately with LCI (82.3% vs. 87.2%, p < 0.001). Again this increase was more profound for the more challenging cases (70.4% vs. 83.4%, p < 0.001). Non-experts indicated to prefer LCI over WLE. Conclusion: The addition of LCI next to WLE improves visualization of EGC. Experts reach higher consensus on discrimination between neoplasia and inflammation when using LCI. Non-experts improve their targeted biopsy placement with the use of LCI. LCI therefore appears to be a useful tool for identification of EGC.

Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of putative biomarkers. Results: Five lipids detected in the positive ion mode and seven in negative ion mode displayed higher relative intensities in the cancerous than the paracancerous tissues. Seven lipids detected in the positive ion mode and seven in the negative ion mode displayed lower relative intensities in the cancerous than the paracancerous regions. Phosphatidylcholine (34:3) and phosphatidylcholine (36:1) showed higher relative intensities in the cancerous than in the paracancerous tissues and showed higher relative intensities in the serum of EGC patients than healthy controls.

The aim of this study was to clarify the difference in learning effect in each lesion characteristic. Methods: Three hundred sixty-five participants diagnosed 40 gastric lesions based on M-NBI findings using the vessel-plus-surface classification system. The diagnosis data collected from each participant were assessed in this study. The accuracy of NBI cancer diagnosis was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC/ROC) analysis. AUC/ROCs were separately calculated in each lesion characteristic (shape and size), and the data were compared between tests 1 and 3. Results: Continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI) analysis of all lesions revealed significant improvement in reclassification when participants underwent e-learning (cNRI, 1.17; P < .01). The integrated discrimination improvement analysis demonstrated that the e-learning system improved diagnostic ability (.19; P < .01).

The cNRI analysis showed remarkable e-learning improvement in both depressed (cNRI, 1.33; P < .01) and small lesions (cNRI, 1.46; P < .01). However, no significant e-learning improvement was observed in elevated or flat lesions. Conclusions: In M-NBI education for endoscopists, a good learning outcome was obtained in depressed and small lesions, but a poor learning outcome was demonstrated in elevated and flat lesions.",Sep-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:04,,440-+,,3,90,,Gastrointest.

With the increasing availability of endoscopic therapy, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, for treating advanced dysplasia and early gastric cancer, establishing guidelines for screening and surveillance of patients who are at high risk of developing gastric cancer has the potential to diagnose and treat gastric cancer at an earlier stage and improve mortality from gastric cancer. The aims of this article were to review the data regarding the risk factors for developing gastric cancer, methods for gastric cancer screening, and results of national screening programs. Methods: A review of the existing literature related to the aims was performed. Results: Risk factors for gastric cancer that were identified include race/ethnicity (East Asian, Russian, or South American), first-degree relative diagnosed with gastric cancer, positive Helicobacter pylori status, and presence of atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia. Endoscopy has the highest rate of detecting gastric cancer compared with other gastric cancer screening methods. The national screening program in Japan has demonstrated a mortality reduction from gastric cancer based on cohort data. Conclusions: Gastric cancer screening with endoscopy should be considered in individuals who are immigrants from regions associated with a high risk of gastric cancer (East Asia, Russia, or South America) or who have a family history of gastric cancer. Those with findings of atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia on screening endoscopy should undergo surveillance endoscopy every 1 to 2 years. Large prospective multicenter studies are needed to further identify additional risk factors for developing gastric cancer and to assess whether gastric cancer screening programs for high-risk populations in the United States would result in improved mortality.",Jul-16,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:11,,18-28,,1,84,,Gastrointest.

The accurate prediction of invasion depth based on endoscopic images is crucial for screening patients for endoscopic resection. We constructed a convolutional neural network computer-aided detection (CNN CAD) system based on endoscopic images to determine invasion depth and screen patients for endoscopic resection. Methods: Endoscopic images of gastric cancer tumors were obtained from the Endoscopy Center of Zhongshan Hospital. An artificial intelligence based CNN-CAD system was developed through transfer learning leveraging a state-of-the-art pretrained CNN architecture, ResNet50. A total of 790 images served as a development dataset and another 203 images as a test dataset. We used the CNN-CAD system to determine the invasion depth of gastric cancer and evaluated the system's classification accuracy by calculating its sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the CNN-CAD system was.94 (95% confidence interval [CI],.90-.97). At a threshold value of.5, sensitivity was 76.47%, and specificity 95.56%. Overall accuracy was 89.16%. Positive and negative predictive values were 89.66% and 88.97%, respectively. The CNN CAD system achieved significantly higher accuracy (by 17.25%; 95% CI, 11.63-22.59) and specificity (by 32.21%; 95% CI, 26.78-37.44) than human endoscopists. Conclusions: We constructed a CNN-CAD system to determine the invasion depth of gastric cancer with high accuracy and specificity. This system distinguished early gastric cancer from deeper submucosal invasion and minimized overestimation of invasion depth, which could reduce unnecessary gastrectomy.",Apr-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,806-+,,4,89,,Gastrointest.

Screening for gastric diseases in symptomatic outpatients with conventional esophagogastroduodenoscopy (C-EGD) is expensive and has poor compliance. We aimed to explore the efficiency and safety of magnetic-controlled capsule gastroscopy (MCCG) in symptomatic outpatients who refused C-EGD. Methods. We performed a retrospective study of 76794 consecutive symptomatic outpatients from January 2014 to October 2019. A total of 2318 adults (F/M=1064/1254) in the MCCG group who refused C-EGD were matched with adults in the C-EGD group using propensity-score matching (PSM). The detection rates of abnormalities were analyzed to explore the application of MCCG in symptomatic patients. Results. Our study demonstrated a prevalence of gastric ulcers (GUs) in patients with functional dyspepsia- (FD-) like symptoms of 8.14%. The detection rate of esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus was higher in patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms than in patients in the other four groups (P<0.01). The detection rates of gastric ulcers in the five groups (abdominal pain, bloating, heartburn, follow-up, and bleeding) were significantly different (P=0.015). The total detection rate of gastric ulcers in symptomatic patients was 9.7%. A total of 7 advanced carcinomas were detected by MCCG and confirmed by endoscopic or surgical biopsy. The advanced gastric cancer detection rate was not significantly different between the MCCG group and the C-EGD matched group in terms of nonhematemesis GI bleeding (2 vs. 2, P=1.00). In addition, the overall focal lesion detection rate in the MCCG group was superior to that in the C-EGD matched group (224 vs. 184, P=0.038). MCCG gained a clinically meaningful small bowel diagnostic yield of 54.8% (17/31) out of 31 cases of suspected small bowel bleeding. No patient reported capsule retention at the two-week follow-up. Conclusion. MCCG is well tolerated, safe, and technically feasible and has a considerable diagnostic yield. The overall gastric diagnostic yield of gastric focal lesions with MCCG was comparable to that with C-EGD. MCCG offered a supplementary diagnosis in patients who had a previously undiagnostic C-EGD, indicating that MCCG could play an important role in the routine monitoring and follow-up of outpatient. MCCG shows its safety and efficiency in symptomatic outpatient applications.",2021/10/12,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:57,,6934594,,6934594,2021,,Gastroenterol. Res.

This study aimed to investigate the demarcation line diagnostic performance of NBI in early gastric cancer compared to that of white-light imaging (WLI) using prospectively collected consecutive specimens from early gastric cancer patients. Methods Thirty consecutive lesions were collected from patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer. Next, 30 NBI and 30 WLI images, each with the same degree of gastric wall extension, angle, and layout for one lesion, were selected, and a total of 60 images were prepared for testing. The early gastric cancer invasion ranges in the endoscopic images was plotted using the web-developed software, and 264 independent endoscopists, unaware of the diagnosis, performed the web tests, with the concordance rates between the ranges of responses. After estimating the actual early gastric cancer invasion ranges, the NBI and WLI results were compared. Results The concordance rates for NBI and WLI images were 43.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42.5-43.7%) and 37.2% (95% CI 36.6-37.7%), respectively, showing that the concordance rate for NBI was significantly higher than that for WLI.

We aimed to verify the feasibility of this attempt in a prospective case-registration study (UMIN000028629). Methods Data were collected from 1784 subjects without past eradication of H. pylori and who underwent endoscopic gastric cancer screening in Kurashiki Central Hospital Preventive Healthcare Plaza from September 2017 to June 2018. Endoscopic judgment of H. pylori infection status was made according to the Kyoto classification of gastritis. For comparison, a combination serum test of anti-H. pylori antibody and pepsinogen I and II, the ABC method, was used. Results The endoscopic diagnoses were nongastritis, 1215 (68.1%); active or inactive gastritis, 469 (26.3%); and undefined, 23 (1.3%). With the ABC method as a reference standard, the false-negative rate of the endoscopic judgment for H. pylori infection was 16.3% (95% confidence interval: 13.1%-20.0%). Most false-negative cases were of Group B in the ABC method, which is considered gastritis with mild mucosal atrophy. Antibody titers in this population were mostly in the weak-positive range but clinically significant elevation of the antibody suggesting current infection was observed in some cases. Conclusions Endoscopic diagnosis of H. pylori infection status in a population-based gastric cancer screening program is mostly reliable, but false-negative results may occur, especially in patients with mild gastric atrophy.

Linked color imaging (LCI) is superior to white light imaging (WLI) for detecting gastric cancers. This study aimed to detect gastric cancers on screening endoscopy using not only WLI but also BLI-bright and LCI in patients with atrophic gastritis. Patients and Methods A total of 500 patients with atrophic gastritis undergoing screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy were included. The gastric lumen was observed in the WLI mode, followed by the LCI and BLI-bright modes. When gastric neoplasms were suspected, the mode was changed to WLI, and we sprayed indigo carmine. Finally, biopsy specimens were taken for those lesions and pathological diagnosis was made. We compared the size, morphology, and color of gastric neoplasms found by the first WLI mode and those detected by only the LCI mode or BLI-bright mode. Results We detected 16 gastric neoplasms (3.2%), of which 13 were early gastric cancers (EGCs) and three were gastric adenomas. Ten EGCs and two gastric adenomas (75%) were detected by the first WLI mode; three EGCs and one gastric adenoma (25%) were missed by the first WLI mode and were detected by the LCI mode or BLI-bright mode.

Limited data are available on upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer risk in iFOBT-positive patients. This study investigated the incidence of UGI malignancies diagnosed within 3 years post-colonoscopy after a positive iFOBT.MethodsRetrospective analysis of iFOBT-positive patients aged 50-75 years who underwent a colonoscopy at a single institution. All patients with a diagnosis of UGI cancer within 3 years post-colonoscopy were identified by linking with the Queensland Cancer Register. This was used to compare to the geographical population aged 50-74 years based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Queensland Cancer Council data.ResultsFrom 1748 eligible participants, 0.23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-0.58) were diagnosed with UGI cancer within 3 years post-colonoscopy. This indicates an esophageal cancers rate of 114.42 per 100 000 (95% CI 100.56-298.28) and gastric cancer rate of 57.21 per 100 000 (95% CI 55.76-261.12).

Some authors have adopted a non-surgical closure method in chosen cases and, since 1993, endoclips have been used to close perforation in the stomach. The endoscopic practice of endoclips has been commonly used in the gut for hemostasis. Currently, the use of endoscopic techniques is increasing for the closure of endoscopic submucosal dissection or endoscopic mucosal resection. Endoscopic perforations that improved with endoscopic closure in the literature prior to 2008 have been previously described. In the present article, we present a descriptive review of cases with iatrogenic perforation in the gut treated with endoclips between 2008 and 2014. MethodsComprehensive literature screening and a systematic review using PubMed and Medline was done for all reports published between January 2008 and December 2014 using the endoclip technique in the closure of iatrogenic perforations. ResultsA total of 47 studies published between 2008 and 2014 using endoclips for the closure of iatrogenic perforations of the gut (nine esophagus, 11 stomach, 15 duodenum, 12 colon and rectum) were found.

Serum levels of pepsinogen (PG) are known to be excellent markers for evaluating the degree of atrophic gastritis. We investigated whether chronic gastritis could be diagnosed by evaluating serum PG levels. MethodsA total of 4483 patients (average age, 49.7 years; 2879 men) were included in this study. Fasting serum samples were collected and anti-H.pylori antibody and PG levels were evaluated. We evaluated the endoscopic atrophy grade or histological extent of gastritis, and calculated the diagnostic capability of this serum marker. ResultsA total of 4483 patients, were diagnosed as being positive (4160) or negative (323) for H.pylori-induced gastritis. In patients with H.pylori-induced gastritis, the PG II levels were higher and the PG I/II ratios were lower than among those without H.pylori gastritis. A cut-off values of (i) PG I/II 5; (ii) PG II 10 or PG I/II 5; (iii) PG II 12 or PG I/II 4.5 showed high sensitivity and accuracy (over 90%) for diagnosing H.pylori-induced gastritis. Moreover, in a mass screening of healthy subjects, a cut-off value of PG I/II 4.5 might be better for diagnosing the presence of gastritis because of a sensitivity and specificity >80%.

Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) enables invivo real-time optical biopsy. We compared the diagnostic yields for these EGC cases using conventional white light endoscopy (WL), magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI), pCLE, and endoscopic biopsy; we also compared the accuracy of the horizontal extent diagnosis between ME-NBI and pCLE. MethodsThis study enrolled 30 patients with 36 EGC lesions after successful Hp eradication. Diagnostic yields of WL, ME-NBI, pCLE, and endoscopic biopsy were prospectively compared. Four points of cancerous margins (oral, anal, anterior, and posterior sites) were also prospectively evaluated with M-NBI and pCLE to determine the horizontal extent of the EGC. ResultsDiagnostic yield was significantly higher with pCLE than with WL and endoscopic biopsy (97 vs 72%, 97 vs 72%, P=0.0159, 0.0077, respectively), whereas it did not differ from ME-NBI (88.9%, P=0.371). Height of non-tumorous regenerative epithelium or maturated atypical glands was 104.734.2m in the pCLE-positive cases, whereas it was 188.3 +/- 27.1m in a pCLE-negative case (P=0.0004). Diagnostic accuracy of the horizontal margin of EGC was significantly higher with pCLE than with ME-NBI (92 vs 70%, P=0.0159). ConclusionpCLE may be helpful for the diagnosis of ambiguous ECG found after Hp eradication because it enables real-time scanning throughout the lesion and detection of subsurface microstructure.",Mar-18,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,219-227,,2,30,,Dig.

This Summit meeting was called to discuss the optimal management of digestive cancers and the role of Gastroenterologists Method: Experts from Asia Pacific countries in the fields of medical, oncologic, surgical and endoscopic management of cancers in the esophagus, stomach, colon/rectum and the liver reviewed the literature and their practice. 18 position statements were drafted, debated and voted. Results: It was agreed that the burden on GI cancer is increasing. More research will be warranted on chemotherapy, chemoprevention, cost-effectiveness of treatment and nutrition. Cancer management guidelines should be developed in this region when more clinical data are available. In order to improve care to patients, a multi-disciplinary team coordinated by a cancer therapist is proposed. This cancer therapist can be a gastroenterologist, a surgeon or any related discipline who have acquired core competence training.

Methods: Six hundred and ten patients were randomly allocated to two groups based on type of premedication given. Premedication used in the control group was 10 mL lidocaine hydrochloride mucilage (LHM, N = 314) and premedication used in the intervention group was 80 mL simethicone/Pronase solution plus 10 mL lidocaine hydrochloride mucilage (SP/LHM, N = 296). EGD was done under sedation. Visibility scores, number of mucosal areas that needed cleansing, water consumption for cleansing, time taken for examination, diminutive lesions, pathological diagnosis, patients' gag reflex and oxygenation (pulse oximetry) were recorded. Results: SP/LHM has significantly lower total visibility score than LHM (7.978 +/- 1.526 vs 6.348 +/- 1.097, P < 0.01). During the procedure, number of intragastric areas that needed cleansing and amount of water consumed were significantly less in the SP/LHM than in the LHM group (P < 0.01). In SP/LHM (P = 0.01), endoscopy procedure duration was significantly longer. Although there was no significant difference in rate of detection of diminutive lesions between LHM and SP/LHM, the endoscopist carried out more biopsies in SP/LHM. This led to a higher rate of diagnosis of atrophic gastritis (P = 0.014) and intestinal metaplasia (P = 0.024).

We studied the association between diabetic biomarkers and the risk of gastric cancer and whether these associations depend on cancer location. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study with subjects with negative initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings (n = 23 218) during a routine health checkup, we measured fasting glucose and insulin levels, calculated the homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values, and analyzed the risk of gastric cancer in relation to diabetic biomarker tertiles and the presence of diabetes mellitus. Results: The incidence rate of gastric cancer was 9.7 per 10 000 person-years during the mean 6.8-year follow up. Patients with diabetes, higher fasting glucose levels, or higher HOMA-IR levels were older; men, current smokers, and heavy alcohol consumers represented larger proportions of these groups. They also had high body mass index and hemoglobin A1c more often. In the multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analyses, the incidence of gastric cancer was not significantly associated with diabetes mellitus or higher diabetic biomarker levels. Compared with normal glucose levels, lower glucose levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of distal gastric cancer. The hazard ratio for fasting glucose level tertile 1 was 2.39 (95% confidence interval, 1.48-3.85) (reference, tertile 2).

However, it has not been determined whether endoscopic screening with a shorter interval is beneficial, especially for high-risk groups. Methods: Atotal of 415 patients with GC were categorized according to whether they had (vigilant screening group) or not (non-vigilant screening group) undergone endoscopic screening within 1 year before being diagnosed with GC. Clinicopathologic GC characteristics of the two groups were compared. Next, the same analyses were conducted in subgroups of patients with high risk for GC including males, current smokers, first-degree relatives of GC; and patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, gastric atrophy, or intestinal metaplasia (IM). Results: The proportion of vigilant screening patients was 36.1%.

Methods: A real-world, two-center study was conducted at Wenzhou Central Hospital (WCH) and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (RHWU). High biopsy rate and low biopsy rate strategies were adopted, and CAD devices were applied in 2019 and 2021 at WCH and RHWU, respectively.

Due to an abundance of modifications, tRFs have the potential to serve as cancer biomarkers. However, the relationship between tRFs and gastric cancer is still largely unclear. We have identified a new tRF, tRF-19-3L7L73JD, found to be expressed at a lower level in gastric cancer patients than healthy controls. Our study aims to explore the diagnostic value of tRF-19-3L7L73JD screening in gastric cancer and to investigate its effects on the growth of gastric cancer cells. Methods: Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we identified tRF-3L7L73JD as differentially expressed in plasma from gastric cancer patients compared to healthy controls. We measured tRF-3L7L73JD levels in plasma from 40 gastric cancer patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, we tested another cohort containing 89 gastric cancer patients and 98 healthy controls to validate our findings. Next, we analyzed the relationship between levels of tRF-19-3L7L73JD in plasma and clinicopathological data of gastric cancer patients, and then evaluated the effects of tRF-19-3L7L73JD on gastric cancer cell growth. Cell proliferation was measured by the Cell Counting Kit-8 and clone formation experiments after transfer with tRF-19-3L7L73JD mimics. The changes in cell migration ability were explored through the scratch and Transwell experiments. Finally, we explored changes in apoptosis and cell cycle by flow cytometry. Results: tRF-19-3L7L73JD showed lower expression in the tested gastric cancer patients. In the validation cohort tRF-19-3L7L73JD was also expressed at low levels in the pre-operative plasma group compared with healthy plasma and post-operative plasma groups. Additionally, a comparison of gastric cancer cell lines with normal gastric epithelial cell lines produced the same result. We found that tRF-19-3L7L73JD expression in patients was related to tumor size. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.6230, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.4045 and 0.7959, respectively. Cellular function studies revealed that tRF-19-3L7L73JD inhibited cell proliferation and migration, induced apoptosis, and arrested cells at G(0)/G(1) phases, suggesting it may suppress the development of gastric cancer.

Magnifying narrow-band imaging has been reported to be effective for accurate diagnosis of gastric abnormalities such as cancers, adenomas, and intestinal metaplasia. However, the efficacy of this method in routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy has not been clarified. Methods: We divided 3763 patients into two groups. The non-magnification group included 1842 patients who underwent endoscopy screening using GIF-H260/LUCERA-SPECTRUM between October 2014 and February 2015, whereas the magnification group included 1921 patients who underwent screening using GIF-H290Z/LUCERA-ELITE between March 2015 and May 2015. In the magnification group, diagnosis of cancer was conducted using the VS classification system. We did not carry out a biopsy when results were confirmed as non-cancer using magnifying narrow-band imaging. If cancer was diagnosed, or when a cancer or non-cancer diagnosis was difficult, we carried out a biopsy. We analyzed and compared the diagnostic performance between the two groups. Results: Gastric biopsy rate was significantly lower in the magnification group (29%) than in the non-magnification group (41%) (P < 0.001). Positive predictive value (PPV) for gastric cancer was significantly higher in the magnification group (5.5%) than in the non-magnification group (2.5%) (P < 0.001).

We evaluated whether H. pylori infection and premalignant histological changes are more prevalent in siblings of young gastric cancer patients. Methods: Young (age <= 40) gastric cancer patients (n = 185), their young siblings (n = 130), and young control participants (n = 287) were recruited. H. pylori infection and histological changes were assessed using the updated Sydney system in biopsy specimens from three regions. We analyzed the association of H. pylori infection and histological changes with gastric cancer using logistic regression analysis. Results: The H. pylori infection rate was significantly higher in young cancer patients than their siblings (odds ratio [OR] = 2.42, P = 0.001) or control participants (OR = 3.60, P < 0.001). In H. pylori-infected subjects, corpus gastritis and premalignant changes of the corpus lesser curvature (LCv) were also more prevalent in patients than in siblings or controls. In terms of the antrum, intestinal metaplasia was more prevalent in H. pylori-infected patients than in siblings or controls, while atrophy was not affected. Siblings also had a higher H. pylori infection rate (OR = 1.60, P = 0.046) and higher prevalence of intestinal metaplasia at the corpus LCv (OR = 2.88, P = 0.027) than control participants.

This study identified risk factors of gastric precancerous conditions in a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study. Methods: Individuals who made their visit to 115 hospitals in China for gastric cancer screening were recruited. Lifestyle habits and personal information were collected through a series of questionnaires. Serum biomarker test (pepsinogen I, pepsinogen II, gastrin-17, and anti-Helicobacter pylori immunoglobulin G antibody) and endoscopy were then performed. Risk factors for gastric precancerous conditions were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Of 14,929 subjects eligible for analysis, 4477 (30.0%) developed gastric precancerous conditions and 405 (2.71%) developed gastric cancer. In multiple logistic regression, precancerous conditions were associated with advanced age [odds ratio (OR)=1.027; 95% confidence interval (Cl), 1.023-1.032; P< 0.001], male gender (OR=1.303; 95% Cl, 1.188-1.429; P< 0.001), H. pylori infection (OR=1.377; 95% Cl, 1.272-1.490, P< 0.001), and smoking (OR=1.142; 95% Cl, 1.005-1.298, P=0.004), whereas they were inversely correlated with white meat intake (OR=0.731; 95% Cl, 0.673-0.794; P< 0.001) and pepsinogen I level (30 to 70 subgroup OR=1.536; 95% Cl, 1.163-2.028; P=0.002; <30 subgroup OR=1.354; 95% Cl, 1.206-1.520; P< 0.001).

This study was designed to evaluate the possible use of new biomarkers, namely SAA and HMGB1, for early diagnosis of gastric cancer. Methods: A total of 100 patients presenting with gastric symptoms were included. All patients underwent upper endoscopic evaluation, histopathological diagnosis and serum CEA, SAA, and HMGB1 measurements. Results: Patients were classed endoscopically with neoplastic, inflammatory, and normal-appearing gastric mucosa: 50, 25, and 25 patients, respectively. Histologically, half the patients had chronic gastritis and the remaining cases gastric carcinoma of diffuse (n=28) or intestinal (n=22) type. SAA at cutoff of 18.5 mg/L had the best validity to differentiate gastritis from gastric carcinoma, with AUC, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.99, 98%, 100%, 100%, and 98%, respectively, followed by HMGB1 at cutoff of 14.5 pg/mu L, with AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.91, 70%, 96%, 94.6%, and 76.2%, respectively.

Due to the complex initiation and intricate progression mechanisms, early detection and effective treatment of gastric cancer are both difficult to achieve. The genetic polymorphisms encoding critical protein cyclin D1 (CCND1) to regulate cell cycle transition from G1 phase to S phase may determine the susceptibility of individuals to gastric cancer. The study aimed to examine the contribution of CCND1 genotypes to gastric cancer risk in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The genotypes of CCND1 A870G (rs9344) and G1722C (rs678653) were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis among 358 gastric patients and 358 cancer-free controls, and the distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies among the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The results showed that there were significant differences between gastric cancer and control groups in the distribution of the genotypes (p=6.86x10(-4)) and allelic frequency (p=0.0016) in the CCND1 A870G genotype. In addition, individuals who carried the AG or GG genotype had 0.55- and 0.51-fold of odds ratios of developing gastric cancer compared to those who carried the AA genotype (95% confidence intervals [CI]=0.39-0.76 and 0.32-0.81, respectively). There was no such association of CCND1 G1722C with gastric cancer. Furthermore, there was an obvious interaction of the CCND1 A870G genotype with personal smoking habit on gastric cancer risk (p=0.0005). CONCLUSION: Cell-cycle regulation may play a role in gastric cancer initiation and development and the CCND1 A870G genotype maybe a useful biomarker for detection of early gastric cancer.",2014,2025/4/23 19:24,2025/4/23 19:52,,,,9,34,,Anticancer Res,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,"Num Pages: 4963-8 Place: EDITORIAL OFFICE 1ST KM KAPANDRITIOU-KALAMOU RD KAPANDRITI, PO BOX 22, ATHENS 19014, GREECE Publisher: Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.

However, the reports have not clearly stated the criteria of indications. In the present study, we retrospectively elucidated the usefulness and problems of ESD for early gastric cancer in elderly patients (= 65 years) in comparison with non-elderly patients. Methods: The subjects were selected from 412 consecutive patients with early gastric cancer (515 lesions) for which ESD was performed between June 2002 and February 2010. The following were used for analysis between groups: pre-and postoperative performance status (PS) of subjects, prevalence rates of pre-existing comorbidities, characteristics of lesions, treatment outcomes, durations of hospitalization, operating times, incidence rates of complications and durations of hospitalization, and postoperative hemorrhage rates, and duration of hospitalization in patients with anticoagulant therapy. Results: Of the lesions in the elderly, four patients (1.0%) were elderly with a PS of 3. The PS increased to six patients (1.6%) after the procedure. None of the non-elderly had a PS of 3 before or after the procedure. The ratio of patients with a pre-existing comorbidity was higher in the elderly than in the non-elderly. There were no differences between the two groups in the characteristics of the lesions, their duration of hospitalization, their operating times, or the incidence rates of complications. However, the elderly with perforations had a significantly longer hospitalization than the comparable non-elderly. The percentage of the patients taking anticoagulant drugs was significantly higher among the elderly. Of the patients on anticoagulant therapy, the duration of hospitalization tended to be longer in the elderly but no significant difference was found. None of the non-elderly with postoperative hemorrhage had received anticoagulant therapy. In the elderly with postoperative hemorrhage, 15.8% of the lesions were in those who had received anticoagulant therapy, indicating a significantly higher percentage of such lesions in the elderly group. Conclusion: We conclude that ESD is useful in elderly patients because there is a similar risk as for the non-elderly if the approach is individualized, and the following are taken into consideration when making the final decision of performing ESD in an elderly patient: patients should have a PS of 0, 1, or 2; determine whether or not anticoagulant therapy can be discontinued and whether or not treatment can be performed reliably without complications.",Apr-12,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:18,,63-69,,s3,27,,J.

However, its performance is limited by the endoscopist's skill, and no standards are available for lesion identification. Thus, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to replace chromoendoscopy.Methods: This pilot study assessed the feasibility of our novel AI model in the conversion of white-light images (WLI) into virtual IC-dyed images based on a generative adversarial network. The predictions of our AI model were evaluated against the assessments of five endoscopic experts who were blinded to the purpose of this study with a staining quality rating from 1 (unacceptable) to 4 (excellent).Results: The AI model successfully transformed the WLI of polyps with different morphologies and different types of lesions in the gastrointestinal tract into virtual IC-dyed images. The quality ratings of the real IC-dyed and AI images did not significantly differ concerning surface structure (AI vs IC: 3.08 vs 3.00), lesion border (3.04 vs 2.98), and overall contrast (3.14 vs 3.02) from 10 sets of images (10 AI images and 10 real IC-dyed images). Although the score depended significantly on the evaluator, the staining methods (AI or real IC) and evaluators had no significant interaction (P > 0.05) with each other.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the feasibility of employing AI model's virtual IC staining, increasing the possibility of being employed in daily practice.

Based on this novel basic concept, we analyzed the usefulness of serum exosomal Dicer as a diagnostic biomarker for gastrointestinal cancers. Methods: Enrolled participants (691) were categorized into 3 groups: gastric cancer (GC) cohort, 183 patients (90 healthy controls (HCs) and 93 GC patients); esophageal cancer (EC) cohort, 115 patients (90 HCs and 25 EC patients); and colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort, 188 patients (92 HCs and 96 CRC patients) after age- and sex matching using the propensity score. The quality of isolated serum exosomes was validated with an electron microscope, particle size analyzer, and exosome marker, CD63. Results: Serum exosomal Dicer was significantly higher in the GC group than in the HC group (p = 0.004), whereas no significant differences were found in both EC and CRC cohorts. Serum exosomal Dicer was significantly higher in only differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma and not in the undifferentiated type. Moreover, serum exosomal Dicer showed no significant differences regardless of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status. The biomarker panel combining serum exosomal Dicer with H. pylori status distinguished between HC and differentiated GC patients with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.762.

A total of 2288 images from 132 patients served as the development dataset, and 1220 images from 68 patients served as the testing dataset. Invasion depth was evaluated for each image and lesion. The majority vote was applied to lesion-based evaluation. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosing M cancer were 84.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82.3%-87.5%), 70.7% (95% CI 66.8%-74.6%), and 78.9% (95% CI 76.6%-81.2%), respectively, for image-based evaluation, and 85.3% (95% CI 73.4%-97.2%), 82.4% (95% CI 69.5%-95.2%), and 83.8% (95% CI 75.1%-92.6%), respectively, for lesion-based evaluation. Conclusions The application of AI using CNN to evaluate the depth of invasion of EGCs based on endoscopic images is feasible, and it is worth investing more effort to put this new technology into practical use.",Feb-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:57,,352-357,,2,37,,J.

We aim to analyze the clinicopathologic correlation between NOTCH2 and the molecular typing of GC by immunohistochemistry and by transcriptional sequencing. Methods In this immunohistochemical study, we detected NOTCH2, EBER, P53, HER2, MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6 and evaluated the association of NOTCH2 with clinical and histopathological features in a large single-institutional series of gastric adenocarcinomas (n = 488). The correlation was also investigated between immunohistochemical results and survival outcomes. Results High NOTCH2 expression (2+/3+) was found in 139/488 (27.5%) samples analyzed. NOTCH2 expression was correlated with early stage T1 (P < 0.0001), GC in the fundus (P = 0.0364), and positive P53 status (P = 0.0019). We did not find an association between NOTCH2 and HER2, microsatellite instability, EBER, and overall survival. Through RNA sequencing, it was revealed that NOTCH2 plays an important biological function in the pathogenesis and development of GC.

However, acquiring skill at ME-NBI diagnosis of early gastric cancer (EGC) requires considerable expertise and experience. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), using deep learning and a convolutional neural network (CNN), has made remarkable progress in various medical fields. Here, we constructed an AI-assisted CNN computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system, based on ME-NBI images, to diagnose EGC and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the AI-assisted CNN-CAD system. Methods The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system (ResNet50) was trained and validated on a dataset of 5574 ME-NBI images (3797 EGCs, 1777 non-cancerous mucosa and lesions). To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, a separate test dataset of 2300 ME-NBI images (1430 EGCs, 870 non-cancerous mucosa and lesions) was assessed using the AI-assisted CNN-CAD system. Results The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system required 60 s to analyze 2300 test images. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the CNN were 98.7%, 98%, 100%, 100%, and 96.8%, respectively. All misdiagnosed images of EGCs were of low-quality or of superficially depressed and intestinal-type intramucosal cancers that were difficult to distinguish from gastritis, even by experienced endoscopists. Conclusions The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system for ME-NBI diagnosis of EGC could process many stored ME-NBI images in a short period of time and had a high diagnostic ability. This system may have great potential for future application to real clinical settings, which could facilitate ME-NBI diagnosis of EGC in practice.",Feb-21,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:02,,482-489,,2,36,,J.

However, whether LCI is more useful than other kinds of image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) in recognizing early gastric cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate LCI efficacy compared with the indigo carmine contrast method (IC), and blue laser imaging-bright (BLI-brt) in early differentiated-type gastric cancer recognition. Methods We retrospectively analyzed early differentiated-type gastric cancer, which were examined by all four imaging techniques (white light imaging, IC, LCI, BLI-brt) at Asahi University Hospital from June 2014 to November 2018. Both subjective evaluation (using ranking score: RS) and objective evaluation (using color difference score: CDS) were adopted to quantify early differentiated-type gastric cancer recognition. Results During this period, 87 lesions were enrolled in this study. Both RS and CDS of LCI were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those of IC and BLI-brt. Both RS and CDS of BLI-brt had no significant difference compared with those of IC. Subgroup analysis revealed that LCI was especially useful in post-Helicobacter pylorieradication patients and flat or depressed lesions compared with IC and BLI-brt.

The study aimed to evaluate the utility of a predictive nomogram based on the Kyoto classification of gastritis for GC. Methods It was a retrospective study that included 2639 patients who received esophagogastroduodenoscopy and serum pepsinogen (PG) assay from January 2019 to November 2019 at the Endoscopy Center of the Department of Gastroenterology, Wenzhou Central Hospital. Routine biopsy was conducted to determine the benign and malignant lesions pathologically. All cases were randomly divided into the training set (70%) and the validation set (30%) by using the bootstrap method. A nomogram was formulated according to multivariate analysis of the training set. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were assessed by concordance index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) as well as calibration curve and were validated by the validation set. Results Among all patients enrolled, 102 of 2636 cases showed LGIN, HGIN and gastric cancer pathology results, whereas the rest cases showed benign pathological results. Multivariate analysis indicated that age, sex, PG I/II ratio and Kyoto classification scores were independent predictive variables for GC. The C-index of the nomogram of the training set was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74 to 0.84) and the AUC of ROC is 0.79. The calibration curve of the nomogram demonstrated an optimal agreement between predicted probability and observed probability of the risk of GC. The C-index was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79 to 0.94) with a calibration curve of better concurrence in the validation set.

However, additional surgical gastrectomy should be considered after non-curative endoscopic resection. We aimed to evaluate the predictive factors associated with non-curative endoscopic resection. Methods Between November 2008 and June 2015, a retrospective study was conducted in a single, tertiary, referral hospital. A total of 596 EGC lesions resected by ESD were analyzed. Noncurative endoscopic resection was defined as the occurrence of lesions associated with piecemeal resection, positive resection margins, lymphovascular invasion, or lesions that did not meet the expanded indications for ESD. Results The rate of non-curative endoscopic resection was 16.1%. The mean follow-up period was 35.3 +/- 25.0 months. Associated predictive factors for non-curative endoscopic resection were female sex (OR, 2.470; p= 0.004), lesion size >= 20 mm (OR 3.714; p < 0.001), longer procedure time (OR 2.449, p = 0.002), ulceration (OR 3.538, p = 0.002), nodularity (OR 2.967, p<0.001), depression (OR 1.806, p = 0.038), undifferentiated carcinoma (OR 2.825, p = 0.031) and lesion located in the mid or upper third of stomach (OR 7.135 and OR 4.155, p<0.001, respectively).

This study aimed to compare the total testing cost per participant between the ABC classification method and the existing protocol.Methods Using the minimization method with sex and age as allocation factors, 1206 participants were randomly assigned to the following two methods for a 5-year intervention: barium photofluorography as primary examination followed by detailed examination with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Ba-Endo) and risk-based upper gastrointestinal endoscopy by ABC classification (ABC-Endo). The primary endpoint was the total testing cost per participant over a 5-year period. The secondary endpoint was the expense required to detect one gastric cancer.Results The total testing cost per participant was 39,711 yen in Ba-Endo (604 participants) and 45,227 yen in ABC-Endo (602 participants), with the latter being significantly higher (p < 0.001).

Endoscopy can detect early gastric cancer with high sensitivity. Aims This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of annual endoscopy versus biennial endoscopy versus no screening for gastric cancer screening in patients after successful Helicobacter pylori eradication. Methods We developed decision trees with Markov models for a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 50 years after successful Helicobacter pylori eradication over a lifetime horizon from a healthcare payer perspective. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life expectancy life-years (LYs) with discounting at a fixed annual rate of 3%, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results In a base-case analysis, biennial endoscopy (US$4305, 19.785QALYs, 19.938LYs) was more cost-effective than annual endoscopy (US$7516, 19.808QALYs, 19.958LYs, ICER; US$135,566/QALY gained) and no screening (US$14,326, 19.704QALYs, 19.873LYs). In scenario analyses, biennial endoscopy for patients with mild-to-moderate gastric mucosal atrophy and annual endoscopy for patients with severe gastric mucosal atrophy were the most cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to incidence of gastric cancer and the proportion of stage I. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay level of US$100,000/QALY gained, biennial endoscopy was optimal 99.9% for patients with mild-to-moderate gastric mucosal atrophy, and that annual endoscopy was optimal 98.4% for patients with severe gastric mucosal atrophy.

Methods A novel scoring system for gastric cancer screening was used to retrospectively analyse the patients who met the screening procedure from April 2017 to December 2019 in our hospital. We divided all of the patients into three groups: low-risk group (0-11 scores), medium-risk group (12-16 scores), and high-risk group (17-23 scores). Statistical analysis was performed on the detection rate of gastric cancer and precursors of gastric cancer among these three groups. Results A total of 6701 patients were enrolled in this study, including 4,352(64.95%) in the low-risk group, 1,948 patients (29.07%) in the medium-risk group, and 401 patients (5.98%) in the high-risk group. The total detection rate of gastric cancer was 2.84% (190/6,701), with a 0.94% rate (41/4,352) in the low-risk group, a 5.18% rate (101/1,948) in the medium-risk group, and a 11.97% rate (48/401) in the high-risk group. There were statistically significant differences in the detection rate of gastric cancer among these three groups (all P < 0.05). The detection rate of early gastric cancer was 46.31% (88/190) among all of the detected gastric cancers in this study. In addition, the detection rates of differentiated gastric cancer and precursors of gastric cancer in the medium-risk group and high-risk group were significantly higher than those in the low-risk group. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the novel scoring system in differentiating GC was 0.79. Conclusion The screening strategy based on the novel scoring system can significantly improve the efficiency of gastric cancer opportunistic screening in hospital visits. Gastroscopy should be strongly recommended for patients in the medium-risk group and high-risk group, and detailed gastroscopy should be adopted as early as possible to improve the detection rate of early gastric cancer.",2022/5/8,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,223,,1,22,,BMC Gastroenterol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 6 Place: London Publisher: BMC Web of Science ID: WOS:000815262100002,,,,Gastric cancer; RISK; CHINA; STATISTICS; Early gastric cancer; COMBINED ASSAY; PYLORI IGG ANTIBODY; PROFILES; BURDEN; Gastric cancer opportunistic screening; Hospital visit; Novel scoring system for gastric cancer screening; Precursors of gastric cancer; SERUM PEPSINOGEN LEVELS; 331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk scores of the controls from the model were significantly lower than those of gastric cancer patients in both our own data (P < 0.001) and GEO external testing data (P < 0.001), and no significant difference between different TNM stage patients (P = 0.09 and 0.66). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the healthy control and benign gastric disease patients in the testing set from GEO (P = 0.10). Conclusions The characteristics of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in cell free DNA are specific to gastric cancer patients, and the diagnostic model constructed by five genes' 5-hydroxymethylcytosine features could effectively identify gastric cancer patients.",Jul-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:52,,735-746,,4,27,,Gastric Cancer,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 12 Place: New York Publisher: Springer Web of Science ID: WOS:001197982300001,,,,Gastric cancer; Cell-free DNA; 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine; 112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim is to determine if presenting symptoms predict gastric cancer precursor lesions in a high-risk population. Patient and Methods Consecutive unique patients evaluated by endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal symptoms at the Los Angeles County Hospital between 2010 and 2014 were evaluated. Presenting symptoms were classified as low- or high-risk depending on the procedure indication as coded using the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (CORI) system. Endoscopy and histology results were used to classify findings as benign, GIM, high-risk GIM, or malignant. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with premalignant or malignant gastric findings who had high-risk clinical indications for endoscopy relative to those with benign results. Results A total of 3699 patients underwent endoscopy to evaluate upper gastrointestinal symptoms. There were 373 (10.1%) patients with GIM of which 278 had high-risk GIM. One hundred and sixty (4.3%) patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer. High-risk indications for upper endoscopy predicted gastric cancer (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.3-2.6]) but not GIM (OR 1.0 [0.8-1.3]) or high-risk GIM (OR 0.9 [0.7-1.2]). Hispanic or Asian patients and patients >50 years old were more likely to have GIM, high-risk GIM, and cancer. Conclusions Performance of upper endoscopy for high-risk indications is inadequate to detect GIM and marginal for malignancy. At risk patients should undergo upper endoscopy for both low- and high-risk symptoms. Screening certain populations deserve additional study and may, in fact, be cost-effective.",Feb-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:06,,e12548,,1,24,,Helicobacter,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 7 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000455205300002,,,,gastric cancer; ENDOSCOPY; SURVEILLANCE; ADENOCARCINOMA; POPULATION; INTESTINAL METAPLASIA; intestinal metaplasia; PREMALIGNANT LESIONS; MANAGEMENT; GUIDELINES; UNITED-STATES; PRECANCEROUS LESIONS; routine screening; upper endoscopy; 707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of precursor lesions. Methods: We estimated the prevalence of atrophic gastritis (AG), gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia in regions with low, medium, and high GC incidence. Because IM is an advanced manifestation of AG, we assessed the prevalence of less advanced precursors, regardless of the presence of more advanced lesions. Prevalence was sub-stratified by Helicobacter pylori infection, symptomatology, and period (<2000, 2000-2010, and >2010). Results: Among the 582 articles that underwent full-text review, 166 studies met inclusion criteria. The global prevalence estimates of AG, IM, and dysplasia were 25.4%, 16.2%, and 2.0%, respectively, on the basis of 126 studies that reported the prevalence of less advanced precursors, regardless of the presence of more advanced lesions. The prevalence of all precursor lesions was higher in high and medium compared with low GC incidence countries (P < .01). Prevalence of AG and IM was significantly higher among H pylori-infected individuals (P < .01) but not statistically different between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (P > .17). All precursors demonstrated a secular decrease in prevalence over time. Conclusions: Gastric precursor lesions have differences in prevalence in regions with differential GC incidence and are associated with H pylori infection. Because of the substantial prevalence of precursor lesions in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, symptomatic evaluation may not be sufficient to identify individuals at risk. These estimates provide important insights for tailoring GC prevention strategies.",Aug-24,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:51,,1605-1617,,8,22,,Clin. Gastroenterol.

We performed a population-based study to make a more precise estimate of factors associated with missed lesions in England. METHODS: We performed a retrospective population-based observational cohort study of 2727 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer from April 2011 through March 2012 in England, using linked records from 3 national data sets. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had undergone endoscopy in the 3 to 36 months before a diagnosis of gastric cancer. We determined this proportion for the entire cohort and for subgroups. RESULTS: Of the 2727 patients in the cohort, 8.3% (95% confidence interval, 7.2% 9.3%) underwent endoscopic evaluation in the 3 to 36 months before their diagnosis of gastric cancer. An endoscopy within 3 to 36 months of diagnosis was associated with a diagnosis of early stage cancer (stages 0 or 1, 11.5%; stage 2, 7.9%; stages 3 or 4, 6.9%; P = .01 for stage 0 or 1 vs stage 2 or greater), younger age at diagnosis (<55 y, 13.3% vs y, 7.8%; P = .03), and female sex (10% of women vs 7.3% of men; P = .01). Gastric ulcers were detected in 15% of endoscopies performed at any time in the 3 years before cancer diagnosis, and in 64% of endoscopies performed 3 to 6 months before a diagnosis of gastric cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective analysis of medical records in England, in 8.3% of patients with gastric cancer, their cancer was missed at endoscopy within the 3 previous years.

However, in the absence of screening, patients present with advanced disease, and prognosis is poor. We conducted a cost utility analysis to determine whether endoscopic screening for stomach cancer in intermediate-risk population would be cost-effective and to better define the high-risk groups in the population who would benefit from such strategy. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using a Markov Model. Simulation was performed on Singapore (intermediate-risk) population and various high-risk subgroups. Comparison was made between 2-yearly endoscopic mass screening program versus no screening. Data sources were extracted from relevant studies published from 1980-2004 identified via systematic PUBMED search. Main outcome measures were deaths caused by stomach cancer averted, cost per life saved, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Results: Screening of high-risk group of Chinese men (age-standardized rate, 25.9/100,000) from 50-70 years old is highly cost-effective, with cost benefit of United States $26,836 Per QALY. Screening this cohort of 199,000 subjects prevents 743 stomach cancer deaths and saves 8234 absolute life years. Cost of averting I cancer death is United States $247,600. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to incidence of stomach cancer and cost of screening endoscopy.

The reported high incidence of DGC and limited sensitivity of endoscopy in detection have prompted recommendation for total prophylactic gastrectomy for carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (PLP) germline variants of CDH1. Multigene panel tests have identified increasing numbers of carriers of PLP variants in CDH1 who lack a family history of DGC. We evaluated outcomes of endoscopic surveillance for carriers of PLP variants of CDH1 with and without family history of DGC. METHODS: Individuals from 13 families with germline PLP variants of CDH1 were evaluated at the Michigan Medicine Cancer Genetics Clinic from January 1998 through May 2018. Outcomes of esophagogastroduodenoscopy examinations, histopathology analyses, and surgery were compared between individuals with and without a family history of DGC. RESULTS: We identified 20 carriers of germline CDH1 PLP variants; they underwent endoscopic examinations and/or gastrectomy. None had abnormal findings visible during endoscopy. Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) was detected in 12 of 20 subjects. All but 1 of the carcinomas were tiny and confined to the lamina propria, and 1 was transmural. Seven of 12 subjects who had SRCC reported no diagnoses of DGC in first-degree relatives and did not meet established criteria for CDH1 analysis based on a 3-generation family pedigree. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of individuals with germlines variants of CDH1 that are PLP had histopathologic evidence for DGC on endoscopy and/or gastrectomy. Family history of DGC and endoscopic findings therefore do not appear to be reliable determinants of risk of SRCC in individuals with genetic predisposition to DGC.",Jul-19,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:05,,87-96,,1,157,,Gastroenterology,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: Philadelphia Publisher: W B Saunders Co-Elsevier Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:000471618100045,,,,GUIDELINES; Stomach Cancer; PANEL; FAMILIES; GASTRECTOMY; GERMLINE MUTATIONS; Cadherin 1; CDH1 MUTATIONS; Familial; FOCI; Inherited; 670,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study conducted a quasi-experimental analysis to assess the population impact of these programs on GC mortality. Methods: We used the flexible synthetic control method (SCM) to estimate the effect of the screening programs on age-standardized GC mortality and other upper gastrointestinal (UGI) diseases (esophageal cancer and peptic ulcer) among people aged >= 40 years. World Health Organization mortality data and country-level covariates from the World Bank and the Global Burden of Diseases study were used for the analyses. We compared postintervention trends in outcome with the counterfactual trend of the synthetic control and estimated average postintervention rate ratios (RRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The preintervention fits were acceptable for the analyses of South Korea and Japan's GC mortality but poor for Japan's other UGI disease mortality. The average postintervention RRs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.71-0.96) for GC mortality and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.57-0.90) for other UGI disease mortality in South Korea. The RR reached 0.59 by the 15th year after the initiation of nationwide screening. For Japan, the average RRs were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.88-1.07) for GC mortality and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.68-1.28) for other UGI disease mortality.

We aimed to investigate novel fecal signatures for clinical application in early diagnosis of GCa. METHODS: This was an observational study that included 1043 patients from 10 hospitals in China. In the discovery cohort, 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis was performed in paired samples (tissues and feces) from patients with GCa and chronic gastritis (ChG) to determine differential abundant microbes. Their relative abundances were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to test them as bacterial candidates in the training cohort. Their diagnostic efficacy was validated in the validation cohort. RESULTS: Significant enrichments of Streptococcus anginosus (Sa) and Streptococcus constellatus (Sc) in GCa tumor tissues (P < .05) and feces (P < .0001) were observed in patients with intraepithelial neoplasia, early and advanced GCa. Either the signature parallel test SaUSc or single signature Sa/Sc demonstrated superior sensitivity (Sa: 75.6% vs 72.1%, P < .05; Sc: 84.4% vs 64.0%, P < .001; and SaUSc: 91.1% vs 81.4%, P < .01) in detecting early GCa compared with advanced GCa (specificity: Sa: 84.0% vs 83.9%, Sc: 70.4% vs 82.3%, and SaU Sc: 64.0% vs 73.4%).

We compared the real-time diagnostic yield of C-WLI for small, depressed gastric mucosal cancers with that of magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI). METHODS: We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial of patients with undiagnosed depressed lesions <10 mm in diameter identified by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that were analyzed by C-WLI (n = 176) or M-NBI (n = 177) immediately after detection; the C-WLI group received M-NBI after C-WLI. We compared the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity between C-WLI and M-NBI and assessed the diagnostic yield of M-NBI conducted in conjunction with C-WLI. Results: Overall, 40 gastric cancers (20 in each group) were identified. The median diagnostic values for M-NBI and C-WLI were as follows: accuracy, 90.4% and 64.8%; sensitivity, 60.0% and 40.0%; and specificity, 94.3% and 67.9%, respectively. The accuracy and specificity of M-NBI were greater than those of C-WLI (P < .001); the difference in sensitivity was not significant (P = .34). The combination of M-NBI with C-WLI significantly enhanced performance compared with C-WLI alone; accuracy increased from (median) 64.8% to 96.6% (P < .001), sensitivity increased from 40.0% to 95.0% (P < .001), and specificity increased from 67.9% to 96.8% (P < .001).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California region diagnosed with GIM from 2000 through 2011. GIM was identified by a keyword search of pathology reports; gastric cancer cases were identified by cross-reference with an internal cancer registry. The incidence of gastric cancer in patients with GIM (n = 923; median age at diagnosis, 68 y) was compared with that of an age-and sex-matched reference population (controls). Risk factors such as ethnicity, smoking status, history of Helicobacter pylori infection, and family history of gastric cancer were evaluated by individual Cox proportional hazards regression. We then performed a second case-cohort study to evaluate the risk of gastric cancer based on the location and extent of GIM. The median duration of follow-up evaluation was 4.6 years (interquartile range, 3.0-6.7 y). RESULTS: We identified 25 patients with GIM who developed gastric cancers. Seventeen cases of cancer were diagnosed at the same time as the diagnosis of GIM. Eight cases of cancer were identified within a median time period of 4.6 years after a diagnosis of GIM (interquartile range, 2-5.7 y). The overall incidence rate for the cohort was 1.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-3.39). Among the risk factors evaluated, only family history (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-9.7; P = .012) and extent of GIM (odds ratio, 9.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-50.4) increased the risk for gastric cancer. The incidence rate for gastric cancer in patients with a positive family history was 8.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.67-23.73). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of patients with GIM listed in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California database, 2.7% were diagnosed with gastric cancer; almost 70% of cases of gastric cancer were detected at the time of GIM diagnosis. Family history and extensive metaplasia were associated with an increased risk of subsequent gastric cancer. Targeted surveillance of patients with these criteria could increase early detection of gastric cancer.",Oct-16,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:11,,1420-1425,,10,14,,Clin. Gastroenterol.

Although the risk of post-endoscopy advanced gastric cancer (AGC) is low, interval AGC remains a concern. We investigated the characteristics and predictors of interval AGC after negative EGD. METHODS: We included 1257 patients with gastric cancer within 6 to 36 months of a ""cancer-negative"" index EGD between 2005 and 2021 at a tertiary university hospital in South Korea. Observation time on the index EGD was used as a quality indicator. We compared the clinical and endoscopic characteristics and quality indicators between interval AGC and screen-detected early gastric cancer (EGC). RESULTS: Within 6 to 36 months of negative EGD, 102 AGCs (8.1%) and 1155 EGCs (91.9%) were iden-tified. The percentage of patients with shorter observation time (<3 minutes) in the index EGD was higher in the interval AGC group than in the detected EGC group (P [ .002). A multivariable analysis comparing screen-detected EGD and interval AGC was adjusted for age, sex, family history of gastric cancer, H. pylori status, endoscopic findings, and endoscopy-related factors including gastric observation time and interval time. A shorter observation time (<3 minutes) (odds ratio, 2.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-4.30), and interval time >2 years (odds ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.24) were associated with an increased risk of interval AGC. CONCLUSION: A shorter observation time during index EGD is an important predictor of interval AGC. Further, withdrawal time longer than 3 minutes may be a quality indicator for screening EGD.",May-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:54,,1205-1213,,5,21,,Clin. Gastroenterol.

It is impossible to visualize the entire stomach with the passive capsule currently used in practice because of the large size of the gastric cavity. A magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) system has been designed to explore the stomach. We performed a prospective study to compare the accuracy of detection of gastric focal lesions by MCE vs conventional gastroscopy (the standard method). METHODS: We performed a multicenter blinded study comparing MCE with conventional gastroscopy in 350 patients (mean age, 46.6 y), with upper abdominal complaints scheduled to undergo gastroscopy at a tertiary center in China from August 2014 through December 2014. All patients underwent MCE, followed by conventional gastroscopy 2 hours later, without sedation. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of detection of gastric focal lesions by MCE, using gastroscopy as the standard. RESULTS: MCE detected gastric focal lesions in the whole stomach with 90.4% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.7%-96.1%), 94.7% specificity(95% CI, 91.9%-97.5%), a positive predictive value of 87.9% (95% CI, 81.7%-94.0%), a negative predictive value of 95.9% (95% CI, 93.4%-98.4%), and 93.4% accuracy (95% CI, 90.83%-96.02%). MCE detected focal lesions in the upper stomach(cardia, fundus, and body) with 90.2% sensitivity (95% CI, 82.0%-98.4%) and 96.7% specificity (95% CI, 94.4%-98.9%). MCE detected focal lesions in the lower stomach(angulus, antrum, and pylorus) with 90.6% sensitivity (95% CI, 82.7%-98.4%) and 97.9% specificity (95% CI, 96.1%-99.7%). MCE detected 1 advanced gastric carcinoma, 2 malignant lymphomas, and 1 early stage gastric tumor. MCE did not miss any lesions of significance (including tumors or large ulcers). Among the 350 patients, 5 reported 9 adverse events (1.4%) and 335 preferred MCE over gastroscopy (95.7%). CONCLUSIONS: MCE detects focal lesions in the upper and lower stomach with comparable accuracy with conventional gastroscopy.

In view of this clinical challenge, novel and robust biomarkers for early detection thus improving prognosis of GC are necessary. The present study is to develop a blood-based long noncoding RNA (LR) signature for the early-detection of GC. METHODS: The present 3-step study incorporated data from 2141 patients, including 888 with GC, 158 with chronic atrophic gastritis, 193 with intestinal metaplasia, 501 healthy donors, and 401 with other gastrointestinal cancers. The LR profile of stage I GC tissue samples were analyzed using tran-scriptomic profiling in discovery phase. The extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived LR signature was identified with a training cohort (n = 554) and validated with 2 external cohorts (n = 429 and n = 504) and a supplemental cohort (n = 69). RESULTS: In discovery phase, one LR (GClnc1) was found to be up-regulated in both tissue and circulating EV samples with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9369 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9073-0.9664) for early-stage GC (stage I/II). The diag-nostic performance of this biomarker was further confirmed in 2 external validation cohorts (Xi'an cohort, AUC: 0.8839; 95% CI: 0.8336-0.9342; Beijing cohort, AUC: 0.9018; 95% CI: 0.8597- 0.9439). Moreover, EV-derived GClnc1 robustly distinguished early-stage GC from precancerous lesions (chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) and GC with negative tradi-tional gastrointestinal biomarkers (CEA, CA72-4, and CA19-9). The low levels of this biomarker in postsurgery and other gastrointestinal tumor plasma samples indicated its GC speci-ficity. CONCLUSIONS: EV-derived GClnc1 serves as a circulating biomarker for the early detection of GC, thus providing opportu-nities for curative surgery and improved survival outcomes.",Aug-23,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:53,,402-+,,2,165,,Gastroenterology,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 25 Place: Philadelphia Publisher: W B Saunders Co-Elsevier Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:001048655300001,,,,METASTASIS; CHINA; STATISTICS; PROGRESS; BIOLOGY; Gastric Cancer; Diagnostic Biomarker; Early Detection; EXOSOME; Extracellular Vesicle; lncRNA GClnc1; NONCODING RNAS; PROFILES; 195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed procedures for data normalization and cutoff determination to define sero-positive signals and ranked them by the signal intensity and frequency of reactivity. To identify autoantibodies with the highest diagnostic value, a 1,150-feature microarray was tested with sera from 100 patients with GC and 100 cancer-free controls, and then the top-ranked 86 antigens were used for the production of focused array that was tested with an independent validation set comprising serum samples from 235 patients with GC, 154 patients with peptic ulcer and gastritis and 213 healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that 45-autoantibody signature could discriminate GC and healthy controls with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (59% sensitivity and 90% specificity), GC and peptic ulcer with AUC of 0.76 and GC and gastritis with AUC of 0.64.

However, studies that systematically assess the diagnostic performance of a large number of autoantibodies are rare. Here, we used bead-based multiplex serology to simultaneously measure autoantibody responses against 64 candidate TAAs in serum samples from 329 gastric cancer patients, 321 healthy controls and 124 participants with other diseases of the upper digestive tract. At 98% specificity, sensitivities for the 64 tested autoantibodies ranged from 0-12% in the training set and a combination of autoantibodies against five TAAs (MAGEA4 + CTAG1 + TP53 + ERBB2_C + SDCCAG8) was able to detect 32% of the gastric cancer patients at a specificity of 87% in the validation set. Sensitivities for early and late stage gastric cancers were similar, while chronic atrophic gastritis, a precursor lesion of gastric cancer, was not detectable. However, the 5-marker combination also detected 26% of the esophageal cancer patients. In conclusion, the tested autoantibodies and combinations alone did not reach sufficient sensitivity for gastric cancer screening. Nevertheless, some autoantibodies, such as anti-MAGEA4, anti-CTAG1 or anti-TP53 and their combinations could possibly contribute to the development of cancer early detection tests (not necessarily restricted to gastric cancer) when being combined with other markers.",2016/5/3,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:12,,25467,,1,6,,Sci Rep,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 10 Place: Berlin Publisher: Nature Portfolio Web of Science ID: WOS:000375253600001,,,,BIOMARKERS; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI INFECTION; IDENTIFICATION; SURVEILLANCE; POPULATION; PERFORMANCE; PROTEINS; COLONOSCOPY; TUMOR-ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS; GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE; 911,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate autoantibody discovery, approaches that allow the simultaneous identification of multiple autoantibodies are preferred. Five such techniques - SEREX, phage display, protein microarray, SERPA and MAPPing - are discussed here.

They also share common modifiable pathogenesis risk factors. As the same strategies used to predict AS could also detect certain cancers, we sought novel serum antibody biomarkers of cancers in atherosclerotic sera sampled by liquid biopsy. Using serological antigen identification by cDNA expression cloning (SEREX) and western blot, we screened and detected the antigens BRCA1-Associated ATM Activator 1 (BRAT1) and WD Repeat Domain 1 (WDR1) in the sera of patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA). Amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunosorbent assay (AlphaLISA) established the upregulation of serum BRAT1 antibody (BRAT1-Abs) and WDR1 antibody (WDR1-Abs) in patients with AS-related diseases compared with healthy subjects. ROC and Spearman's correlation analyses showed that BRAT1-Abs and WDR1-Abs could detect AS-related diseases. Thus, serum BRAT1-Abs and WDR1-Abs are potential AS biomarkers. We used online databases and AlphaLISA detection to compare relative antigen and serum antibody expression and found high BRAT1 and BRAT1-Abs expression in patients with GI cancers. Significant increases (> 0.6) in the AUC for BRAT1-Ab vs. esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer suggested that BRAT1-Ab exhibited better predictive potential for GI cancers than WDR1-Ab. There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between BRAT1-Ab groups (P = 0.12). Nevertheless, a log-rank test disclosed that the highest serum BRAT1-Ab levels were associated with poor ESCC prognosis at 5-60 weeks post-surgery. We validated the foregoing conclusions by comparing serum BRAT1-Ab and WDR1-Ab levels based on the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients with ESCC. Multiple statistical approaches established a correlation between serum BRAT1-Ab levels and platelet counts. BRAT1-Ab upregulation may enable early detection of AS and GI cancers and facilitate the delay of disease progression. Thus, BRAT1-Ab is a potential antibody biomarker for the diagnosis of AS and GI cancers and strongly supports the routine clinical application of liquid biopsy in chronic disease detection and diagnosis.",2022/5/17,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:56,,870086,,870086,12,,Front.

In addition, the incidence and mortality rates of gastric cancer in Gansu province in China are much higher than the average nationwide levels. The present study investigated microRNA (miRNA/miR) profiles in early gastric cancer (EGC) without specific symptoms. miRNA expression levels in five pairs of EGC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous mucosa tissues of patients from Gansu province in China were analyzed using a miRNA microarray. A total of 47 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified. Subsequently, mRNA expression profiles of three pairs of cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 3 Asian patients with stage I or stage II gastric cancer (stage I/II; American Joint Committee on Cancer classification, Eighth Edition) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The target genes of DEMs were filtered from the DEGs using the miRDB database and a miRNA-gene network was constructed. The functions of DEMs were evaluated using the tool for annotations of human miRNAs database, and via Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of the target genes. Finally, survival analyses of DEMs, which were in the miRNA-gene network, was performed. The results suggested that a number of miRNAs, including hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-27a-3p, hsa-miR-126-5p and hsa-miR-424-5p, may serve critical roles in EGC.

Data on study characteristics and results were extracted independently by two reviewers. Overall, 39 articles reporting the detection of 34 different autoantibodies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The most common antibody detection method was enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the most frequently assessed autoantibody was anti-p53, which was tested in 13 studies.

The Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched. Risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) 2 tool. Twenty-four studies evaluated biomarkers in the context of AL following gastroesophageal cancer surgery. Biomarkers were derived from the systemic circulation, mediastinal and peritoneal drains, urine and mediastinal microdialysis. The most commonly evaluated serum biomarkers were C-reactive protein and leucocytes. Both proved to be useful markers for excluding AL owing to its high specificity and negative predictive values. Amylase was the most commonly evaluated peritoneal drain biomarker and significantly elevated levels can predict AL in the early postoperative period. The associated area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve values ranged from 0.482 to 0.994.

The estimated tumor depth was up to the mucosa, and biopsy revealed well and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. ESD was performed for this lesion and en bloc resection with negative margins was achieved. Histopathological examination revealed an adenosquamous carcinoma 8 mm in size invading the deep submucosal layer (1600 mu m), with lymphovascular invasion, consistent with the diagnosis of non-curative resection. Additional gastrectomy was recommended for this patient; however, two months after the ESD, preoperative computed tomography revealed multiple liver metastases, and the patient was considered as an unsuitable candidate for surgical resection. Systemic chemotherapy was therefore started; however, the patient died of gastric cancer 27 mo after the second ESD.

To date, there is a complete absence of clinically useful gastric cancer biomarkers. With the goal of discovering noninvasive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer, we have conducted a case-control study using urine samples from individuals with gastric cancer versus healthy control samples. Of the enrolled 106 patients from September, 2012 to April, 2013, a cohort of 70 patients composed of 35 patients with gastric cancer and 35 age-and sex-matched healthy controls was analyzed. The gastric cancer group was composed of stage IA of 62.9% (22/35). The urinary levels of MMP-9/NGAL complex (uMMP-9/NGAL) and ADAM12 (uADAM12) were significantly higher in the gastric cancer group compared with the healthy control group as determined by monospecific ELISAs (uMMP-9/NGAL: median, 85 pg/mL vs. 0 pg/mL; P = 0.020; uADAM12: median, 3.35 ng/mL vs. 1.44 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both uMMP-9/NGAL and uADAM12 were significant, independent diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer. Moreover, MMP-9/NGAL activity was significantly elevated as determined by gelatin zymography. The combination of uMMP-9/NGAL with uADAM12 distinguished between control samples and gastric cancer samples with an AUC of 0.825 (P < 0.001) in an ROC analysis. Significantly, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated a high coexpression of MMP-9 and NGAL (P < 0.001) and high expression of ADAM12 (P < 0.001) in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues (N = 35). In summary, uMMP-9/NGAL and uADAM12 are potential noninvasive biomarkers for gastric cancer, including early-stage disease.

The present study was conducted to elucidate risk factors for gastric cancer and its precursors, and to model the progression rates from superficial gastritis to gastric cancer. Data were derived from a community-based screening programme for gastric cancer in the Matzu region of Taiwan. A total of 2184 residents participated in a two-stage screening project. Subjects testing positive for Helicobacter pylori infection or pepsinogen (PGI or PII/PGII ratio) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), and subjects with a history of peptic ulcer or other upper gastrointestinal disease or with a family history of gastric cancer were referred to endoscopy. We identified 325 biopsy-proven precursors and gastric cancers, including 148 superficial gastritis (SG), 42 atrophic gastritis (AG), 117 intestinal metaplasia (IM) and two gastric cancers. Three further cancers were diagnosed on endoscopy alone and 14 were later diagnosed in those who did not comply with referral to endoscopy. A Markov process model was used to estimate the progression rates from superficial gastritis through to gastric cancer, with exponential regression to assess the effect of covariates on progression rates. The annual progression rate from SG to AG was 0.0670 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0446-0.0895). Annual progression rates from AG to IM and from IM to gastric cancer were 0.2775 (0.1665-0.3884) and 0.2265 (0.1315-0.3214), respectively. This gives average dwelling times in AG and IM of 3.60 years and 4.42 years, respectively. Progression from no disease to SG was significantly accelerated in those testing positive for H. pylori, those testing positive for PGI and in subjects with a family history of gastric cancer or a personal history of upper gastrointestinal disease.

Moreover, some gastric adenoma/dysplasia may progress to GAC. In this study, the miRNA expression profiles in normal and paired low-/high-grade dysplasia were analyzed using Affymetrix Gene-Chip miRNA arrays. Of the total 2578 mature miRNA probe sets, similar to 1600 showed positive signals when the between normal and paired low-/high-grade dysplasia were compared. To verify the miRNA expression, qRT-PCR analysis was performed to quantify the expression of altered miRNAs between normal and paired low-/high-grade dysplasia. The analysis revealed that hsa-miR-421, hsa-miR-29b-1-5p, and hsa-miR-27b-5p were overexpressed in gastric low-/high-grade dysplasia and that based on these miRNA-target interactions, FBXO1 1 and CREBZF could be considered convincing markers for gastric cancer (GC) progression. Thus, we identified three miRNAs (hsa-miR-421, hsa-miR-29b-1-5p, and hsa-miR-27b-5p) with two mRNAs (FBXO1 1 and CREBZF) that might play an important role in the GC development from premalignant adenomas. Furthermore, these two target mRNAs and three miRNAs were predicted to be potential biomarkers for the progression of GC by miRNA-target interaction analysis.",2018,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:08,,610-616,,6,15,,Int.

We previously reported that aberrant DNA methylation is an early and frequent process in gastric carcinogenesis and could be useful for the detection of gastric neoplasia. Our goal is to find and identify some candidate genes, using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, as a treatment marker for early gastric cancer (EGC). We performed methylated CpG island amplification microarray analysis using 12 gastric washes (six each of pre- and post-endoscopic treatment in each of the same patients). We finally focused on Sox17 gene. We examined the DNA methylation status of Sox17 in a validation set consisting of 128 wash samples (pre, 64; post, 64) at EGC. We next carried out functional studies to identify Sox17. Sox17 showed significant differential methylation between pre- and post-treatments in EGC patients (Sox17, p < 0.0001). Moreover, treating GCa cells that lacked Sox17 expression with a methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, restored the gene's expression. Additionally, the introduction of exogenous Sox17 into silenced cells suppressed colony formation. Gastric wash-based DNA methylation analysis could be useful for early detection of recurrence following endoscopic resection in EGC patients. Our data suggest that the silencing of Sox17 occurs frequently in EGC and may play a key role in the development and progression of the disease.",Apr-12,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:17,,383-393,,2,33,,Tumor Biol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 11 Place: London Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000301189400012,,,,Gastric cancer; STATISTICS; IDENTIFICATION; COLORECTAL-CANCER; ISLAND METHYLATOR PHENOTYPE; TARGET; DNA methylation; ABERRANT METHYLATION; CARCINOMAS; EPIGENETIC INACTIVATION; PROMOTER METHYLATION; Gastric washes; HISTONE DEACETYLATION; Sox17; 1131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell markers CD3 and CD8 were also stained and quantified by automated image analysis. Correlation with clinical features and outcome were analyzed after controlling for potential confounders including EBV infection, HER2, C-met and PCNA expression. 37.8% of the cases showed membranous PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and 74.9% in infiltrating immune cells. PDL1 expression rate was rather higher in patients without metastasis, in EBV positive group and those with C-met and PCNA expression. GC patients with high level PDL1 expression exhibited better survival. GC Patients with higher T cell infiltration also showed elevated PDL1, PDL2 and PD1 expression and predict favorable outcome, indicating an adaptive immune resistance mechanism may exist. The group of patients infiltrated with lower density CD3+ T cells also without PDL1 expression in tumor cells predict the worst outcome in the subgroup of different PTNM stage, which may suggest an inactive immune status.

The aim of present study was to compare the accuracy of EUS and conventional endoscopy (CE) for determining the depth of EGC. In addition, the various clinic-pathologic factors affecting the diagnostic accuracy of EUS, with a particular focus on endoscopic ulcer shapes, were evaluated. We retrospectively reviewed data from 236 consecutive patients with ulcerative EGC. All patients underwent EUS for estimating tumor invasion depth, followed by either curative surgery or endoscopic treatment. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS and CE was evaluated by comparing the final histologic result of resected specimen. The correlation between accuracy of EUS and characteristics of EGC (tumor size, histology, location in stomach, tumor invasion depth, and endoscopic ulcer shapes) was analyzed. Endoscopic ulcer shapes were classified into 3 groups: definite ulcer, superficial ulcer, and ill-defined ulcer. The overall accuracy of EUS and CE for predicting the invasion depth in ulcerative EGC was 68.6% and 55.5%, respectively. Of the 236 patients, 36 patients were classified as definite ulcers, 98 were superficial ulcers, and 102 were ill-defined ulcers, In univariate analysis, EUS accuracy was associated with invasion depth (P=0.023), tumor size (P=0.034), and endoscopic ulcer shapes (P=0.001). In multivariate analysis, there is a significant association between superficial ulcer in CE and EUS accuracy (odds ratio: 2.977; 95% confidence interval: 1.255-7.064; P=0.013).

Although most studies have focused on the metabolism of glucose and glutamine, the upregulation of lipid metabolism is also frequent in cells undergoing oncogenic transformation. In fact, cancer cells need to meet the enhanced demand of plasma membrane synthesis and energy production to support their proliferation. Moreover, lipids are precursors of signaling molecules, termed lipid mediators, which play a role in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Recent methodological advances in lipid analysis have prompted studies aimed at investigating the whole lipid content of a sample (lipidome) to unravel the complexity of lipid changes in cancer patient biofluids. This review focuses on the application of mass spectrometry-based lipidomics for the discovery of cancer biomarkers. Here, we have summarized the main lipid alteration in cancer patients' biofluids and uncovered their potential use for the early detection of the disease and treatment selection. We also discuss the advantages of using biofluid-derived extracellular vesicles as a platform for lipid biomarker discovery.

Prior studies reported a hepatoid component present only in invasive areas and hypothesized that AFPGCs may develop hepatoid features during the process of tumor invasion. We report three cases of AFP-producing early gastric cancer which had an intramucosal hepatoid component. Immunohistochemistry showed that the hepatoid component was diffusely immunoreactive for SALL4, AFP, arginase-1, and HepPar1, and focally for CDX2 and PDX1. An intramucosal transition between the hepatoid component and conventional intramucosal adenocarcinoma was identified. Two patients also had a coexistent fetal enteric component, which was admixed with a hepatoid component. Although at an early stage one patient subsequently developed liver metastasis and a second patient was suspected of having liver metastasis, these were not biopsy-proven.

Methods: DEMs in serum exosomes were screened by microarray analysis and verified by RT-qPCR. The target genes of DEMs were predicted using Targetscan and miRTarBase databases and then overlapped with the DEGs of STAD in TCGA database to obtain the common target genes. Biological function and pathway enrichment were analyzed using enrichr database, and a PPI network was constructed using STRING database. The potential target genes of DEMs were identified using the MCODE and cytoHubba plug-ins of Cytoscape software. Survival analysis were conducted using KMP and TCGA databases. The DEMs-target genes-pathways network was established using Cytoscape software.

This study was conducted to determine whether MIF expression is associated with gastric pathology and whether MIF expression is increased in malignant gastric cells in vitro. Materials and methods: Patients with a normal gastric mucosa, Helicobacter pylori infected gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and gastric adenocarcinoma were included. Immunohistochemistry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to determine MIF expression in gastric epithelial cells and MIF levels in serum, respectively. Five gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, MKN-45, MKN-28, MGC-803, and SGC-7901) and one non-malignant gastric cell line (GES-1) were cultured for 24 hours. MIF protein in the supernatant and MIF mRNA in cultured cells were measured by ELISA and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results: The percentage of MIF expressing epithelial cells was low in normal mucosa (12%) but substantially higher in gastritis (52%), intestinal metaplasia (66%), and gastric cancer (96%) (p < 0.001, ANOVA). Serum MIF levels were low in patients with a normal mucosa ( 576 (82) pg/ml) but higher in patients with gastritis (2100 (349) pg/ml), intestinal metaplasia (4498 ( 253) pg/ml), and gastric cancer (9737 (1249) pg/ml) (p < 0.001, ANOVA).

METHODS: This prospective single-center study investigated inter-subject variability in patients with early-stage gastric/colorectal tumor indicated for endoscopic resection. Subjects were patients with gastric or colorectal tumors who had undergone endoscopic resection between November 2012 and November 2013. Selection criteria included age 20-80 years, either sex, and provision of informed consent. Patients were orally administered 20 mg/kg of 5-ALA enteric-coated capsules (SBI ALApromo Co., Tokyo, Japan). Administration of 5-ALA was followed by endoscopic resection of gastric or colorectal tumors, and the resected specimens were examined using a video autofluorescence processor and a fluorescence endoscope (SAFE-3000 and EB-1970AK, respectively; Pentax, Tokyo, Japan). The primary endpoint was the presence of fluorescence in tumors. Endoscopic, macroscopic, and histopathologic findings of tumors were assessed. We also evaluated adverse events of the present procedure as a secondary endpoint and examined each patient for the presence of known adverse effects of 5-ALA, namely, hematocytopenia, liver dysfunction, hypotension, nausea, and photosensitivity. RESULTS: We enrolled 10 patients (7 men, 3 women) (n = 13 lesions: 10 gastric/3 colorectal tumors). Fluorescence was detected in 7/13 (53.8%) lesions. No significant differences in sex (male: 55.6% vs female: 50.5%, P = 1.00), age (67.1 +/- 1.9 years vs 65.0 +/- 2.0 years, P = 0.45), tumor color (reddish: 60.0% vs discolored: 33.3%, P = 0.56), tumor diameter (15.0 +/- 2.1 mm vs 14.2 +/- 2.3 mm, P = 0.80), macroscopic type (protruded: 70.0% vs depressed 0%, P = 0.07), histologic type (differentiated type: 58.3% vs 0%, P = 0.46), invasion depth (mucosal layer: 55.6% vs submucosal layer: 33.3%, P = 1.00), lymphatic invasion (present: 33.3% vs absent: 50.0%, P = 1.00), venous invasion (present: 0% vs absent: 54.5%, P = 1.00) or procedure time of endoscopic resection (36.3 +/- 8.3 min vs 36.7 +/- 9.0 min, P = 0.98) were observed between the patients with and without fluorescence. Fluorescence detection rate tended to be high for elevated lesions. Liver dysfunction developed in 4/10 (40.0%) patients. The extent of the liver dysfunction was a slight increase in transaminases and total bilirubin levels, which spontaneously improved in the patients. None of the patients developed photosensitivity.

METHODS: A total of 54 lesions in 45 patients diagnosed as gastric adenoma by forceps biopsy were prospectively enrolled in this study and treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) between January 2011 and January 2012. AIM-chromoendoscopy (AIM-CE) was performed followed by ESD. AIM solution was sprinkled and images were recorded every 30 s for 3 min. Clinical characteristics such as tumor size (< 2 cm, >= 2 cm), surface color in white light endoscopy (WLE) (whitish, normochromic or reddish), macroscopic appearance (flat or elevated, depressed), and reddish change in AIM-CE were selected as valuables. RESULTS: En bloc resection was achieved in all 54 cases, with curative resection of fifty two lesions (96.3%). Twenty three lesions (42.6%) were diagnosed as well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and the remaining 31 lesions (57.4%) were gastric adenoma. All adenocarcinoma lesions were well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinomas and were restricted within the mucosal layer. The sensitivity of reddish color change in AIM-CE is significantly higher than that in WLE (vs tumor size >= 2 cm, P = 0.016, vs normochromic or reddish surface color, P = 0.046, vs depressed macroscopic type, P = 0.0030). On the other hand, no significant differences were found in the specificity and accuracy. In univariate analysis, normochromic or reddish surface color in WLE (OR = 3.7, 95%CI: 1.2-12, P = 0.022) and reddish change in AIM-CE (OR = 14, 95%CI: 3.8-70, P < 0.001) were significantly related to diagnosis of early gastric cancer (EGC). In multivariate analysis, only reddish change in AIM-CE (OR = 11, 95%CI: 2.3-66, P = 0.0022) was a significant factor associated with diagnosis of EGC. CONCLUSION: AIM-CE may have potential for screening EGC in patients initially diagnosed as gastric adenoma by forceps biopsy. (C) 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

METHODS: The subjects comprised 450 patients with gastric cancer, 111 individuals with gastric atrophy, and 961 healthy controls. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylon) immunoglobulin G (IgG), PG I and PG II were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric atrophy and gastric cancer were diagnosed by endoscopy and histopathological examinations. Odds ratios and 95%CIs were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Rates of H. pylori infection remained high in Northeastern China. Rates of H. pylori IgG positivity were greater in the gastric cancer and gastric atrophy groups compared to the control group (69.1% and 75.7% vs 49.7%, P < 0.001). Higher levels of PG II (15.9 mu g/L and 13.9 mu g/L vs 11.5 mu g/L, P < 0.001) and lower PG I / PG II ratio (5.4 and 4.6 vs 8.4, P < 0.001) were found in patients with gastric cancer or gastric atrophy compared to healthy controls, whereas no correlation was found between the plasma PG I concentration and risk of gastric cancer (P = 0.537). In addition, multivariate logistic analysis indicated that H. pylori infection and atrophic gastritis were independent risk factors for gastric cancer. Lower plasma PG I /PG H ratio was associated with higher risks of atrophy and gastric cancer. Furthermore, plasma PG II level significantly correlated with H. pylori-infected gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: Serum PG II concentration and PG I /PG 11 ratio are potential biomarkers for H. pylori-infected gastric disease. PG 11 is independently associated with risk of gastric cancer.

METHODS: This study included 232 cases and 264 controls. Recombinant KatA and AhpC proteins were constructed and the levels of antibodies were tested by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Logistic regression was applied to analyze the relationships between KatA, AhpC and GC. The chi(2) trend test was used to evaluate the dose-response relationships between serum KatA and AhpC antibody levels and GC. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the screening accuracy of KatA and AhpC as biomarkers.

Methods: We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. Adopting a healthcare payer's perspective, Markov models simulated the clinical experience of the target population (Singaporean Chinese 50-69 years old) undergoing endoscopic screening, endoscopic surveillance and usual care of do-nothing. The screening strategy examined the cohort every alternate year whereas the surveillance strategy provided annual EGD only to people with precancerous lesions. For each strategy, discounted lifetime costs ($) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated and compared to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify influential parameters and quantify the impact of model uncertainties. Results: Annual EGD surveillance with an ICER of $ 34 200/QALY was deemed cost-effective for GC prevention within the Singapore healthcare system. To inform implementation, the models identified six influential factors and their respective thresholds, namely discount rate (<4.20%), age of starting surveillance (>51.6 years), proportion of program cost in delivering endoscopy (<65%), cost of follow-up EGD (<$484), utility of stage 1 GC patients (>0.72) and odds ratio of GC for high-risk subjects (>3.93). The likelihood that surveillance is the most cost-effective strategy is 69.5% accounting for model uncertainties.

METHODS: Human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells were implanted into 24 severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice, which were randomly divided into metastasis group (n = 8), non-metastasis group (n = 8), and normal group (n = 8). Urinary metabolomic information was obtained by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). RESULTS: There were significant metabolic differences among the three groups (t test, P < 0.05). Ten selected metabolites were different between normal and cancer groups (non-metastasis and metastasis groups), and seven metabolites were also different between non-metastasis and metastasis groups. Two diagnostic models for gastric cancer and metastasis were constructed respectively by the principal component analysis (PCA). These PCA models were confirmed by corresponding receiver operating characteristic analysis (area under the curve = 1.00). CONCLUSION: The urinary metabolomic profile is different, and the selected metabolites might be instructive to clinical diagnosis or screening metastasis for gastric cancer. (C) 2011 Baishideng.

Materials & methods: GJ and serum samples were collected from 87 patients with GC, 38 patients with gastric precancerous lesions and 44 healthy volunteers. The levels of SNCG in GJ and serum samples were detected by ELISA. Results: The levels of SNCG in GJ and serum were significantly higher in the GC group when compared with the GPL group or the control group. The expression of SNCG in GJ and serum was associated with tumor node metastasis stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor size and drinking, and it is important for the diagnosis and prognosis of GC (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The findings highlight the significance of SNCG in GC diagnosis and prognosis and implicate SNCG as a promising candidate for GC treatment. Plain language summary Gastric cancer (GC) has high morbidity and mortality rates due to its concealment in the early stage. At present, CEA, CA19-9, CA125, CA724, AFP, CA242 and CA50 are commonly used for the diagnosis of GC, but the effects are not satisfactory. Thus, a better biomarker for the diagnosis of GC is required. This study found that SNCG is highly expressed in the gastric juice and serum of GC patients and contributes to GC's progression. Detection of SNCG in gastric juice and serum is an ideal method for early diagnosis of GC with high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, SNCG has great value in the prognosis evaluation of GC, and high expression of SNCG predicts shorter survival for patients with GC, which provides a valuable reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of GC.",Sep-22,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 19:55,,3179-3190,,28,18,,Future Oncol.,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 12 Place: Abingdon Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000838226500001,,,,IDENTIFICATION; gastric cancer; EXPRESSION; biomarker; serum; gastric juice; SYNUCLEIN-GAMMA-GENE; 302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ninety-five consecutive patients with gastric cancer were enrolled into the study. The serum pepsinogen I (PG I)/pepsinogen II (PG II) and H. pylori antibody levels were measured. Patients were classified into five groups of ABC (D) stratification according to their serological status. Endoscopic findings of atrophic gastritis and histological differentiation were also analyzed in relation to the ABC (D) stratification. RESULTS: The mean patient age was (67.9 +/- 8.9) years. Three patients (3.2%) were classified into group A, 7 patients (7.4%) into group A', 27 patients (28.4%) into group B, 54 patients (56.8%) into group C, and 4 patients (4.2%) into group D, respectively. There were only three cases in group A when the patients taking acid proton pump inhibitors and those who had undergone eradication therapy for H. pylori (group A') were excluded. These three cases had mucosal atrophy in the grey zone according to the diagnostic manual of ABC (D) stratification. Histologically, the mean age of the patients with well differentiated adenocarcinoma was significantly higher than that of the patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (P < 0.05). There were no differences in the pattern of atrophy in the endoscopies between the well differentiated and poorly differentiated groups. CONCLUSION: ABC (D) stratification is a good method for screening patients with gastric cancers. Endoscopy is needed for grey zone cases to check the extent of mucosal atrophy. (C) 2011 Baishideng.

METHODS: From March 2010 to June 2012, a total of 3616 patients received screening for gastric cancer by magnifying endoscopy. There were 3675 focal gastric lesions detected using conventional high definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE) in four different referential hospitals that were recruited for further investigation using ME and ME-NBI. The images obtained from HD-WLE, ME, and ME-NBI were reviewed by four experienced endoscopists to evaluate their diagnostic effectiveness for EGC. The diagnosis of cancerous and non-cancerous lesions was conducted by evaluating the microvascular and microsurface patterns using the VS classification system. The final endoscopic diagnosis of each lesion was determined by consultation when a disagreement occurred. We used histopathological results as the gold standard for the diagnosis of EGC. RESULTS: Among the 3675 lesions found, 1508 were validated by pathological findings as chronic gastritis, 1279 as chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia, 631 as low-grade neoplasia, and 257 as EGC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of HD-WLE for the diagnosis of EGC were 71.2%, 99.1%, 85.5%, 97.9% and 97.1%, respectively. The results of ME for diagnosing EGC were 81.3%, 98.8%, 83.3%, 98.6% and 97.6%, respectively. The results of ME-NBI for the diagnosis of EGC were 87.2%, 98.6%, 82.1%, 99.0% and 97.8%, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of paired ME and ME-NBI were significantly better than those of HD-WLE (P < 0.05).

METHODS: Ninety depressed-type EGCs in 72 patients were macroscopically and histologically identified. We evaluated the microvascular (MV) and mucosal surface (MS) patterns of depressed-type EGCs using magnifying endoscopy (ME) with narrow-band imaging (NBI) (NBI-ME) and ME enhanced by 1.5% acetic acid, respectively. First, depressed-type EGCs were classified according to MV pattern by NBI-ME. Subsequently, EGCs unclassified by MV pattern were classified according to MS pattern by enhanced ME (EME) images obtained from the same angle. RESULTS: We classified the depressed-type EGCs into the following 2 MV patterns using NBI-ME: a fine-network pattern that indicated differentiated adenocarcinoma (25/25, 100%) and a corkscrew pattern that likely indicated undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (18/23, 78.3%). However, 42 of the 90 (46.7%) lesions could not be classified into MV patterns by NBI-ME. These unclassified lesions were then evaluated for MS patterns using EME, which classified 33 (81.0%) lesions as MS patterns, diagnosed as differentiated adenocarcinoma. As a result, 76 of the 90 (84.4%) lesions were matched with histological diagnoses using a combination of NBI-ME and EME.

METHODS: Samples were obtained from 52 histologically confirmed cases of gastric adenocarcinoma. Gastric tissue and serum of 50 age- and sex-matched individuals with normal gastroscopy and biopsy were obtained as control samples. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to evaluate methylation status of p16 promoter. p16-protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining on paraffin-embedded sections. RESULTS: Methylation was detected in 44.2% (23/52) of tumoral tissues. 60.9% of them were also methylated in serum, i.e., 26.9% of all patients (14/52). Methylation was not detected in tissue and sera of control samples. p16-protein expression was decreased in 61.5% of cases (32/52), and was significantly associated with promoter hypermethylation (P < 0.001). Methylation was significantly more frequent in higher pathological grades (P < 0.05). Methylation was not associated with other clinicopathological features and environmental factors including H pylori infection and smoking. CONCLUSION: p16 promoter hypermethylation is an important event in gastric carcinogenesis. It is the principle mechanism of p16 gene silencing. It is related to malignant tumor behavior. Detection of DNA methylation in serum may be a biomarker for early detection of gastric cancer. (c) 2008 WJG. All rights reserved.",Apr-08,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:19,,2055-2060,,13,14,,World J.

Outcome measures were assessed and compared, including the Japanese endoscopic gastric atrophy (EGA) classification method and the modified OLGA method as well as the modified OLGIM method. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status was determined for all study participants. Stepwise logistic regression modeling was performed to analyze correlations between EGC and the EGA, OLGA and OLGIM methods. RESULTS: For patients with EGC and patients with non-EGC, the proportions of moderate-to-severe EGA cases were 64.8% and 44.9%, respectively (P = 0.005), the proportions of OLGA stages III-IV cases were 52.1% and 22.4%, respectively (P < 0.001), and the proportions of OLGIM stages III-IV cases were 42.3% and 19.9%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Secondary endoscopic examinations (n = 3352) were excluded because most secondary examinations tended to be included in the conventional endoscopy (C-E) group. Detection rates of GCs and FN-GCs were compared between SC-E and C-E groups. FN-GC was defined as GC performed with EGD within the past 3 years without GC detection. Macroscopic types, histopathological characteristics and locations of FN-GCs were compared with firstly found-gastric cancers (FF-GCs) in detail.; RESULTS: SC-E cases (n = 6657) and C-E cases (n = 11644), a total of 18301 cases, were analyzed. GCs were detected in 16 (0.24%) SC-E cases and 40 C-E (0.34%) cases (P = 0.23) and there were 4 FN-GCs (0.06%) in SC-E and 13 (0.11%) in C-E (P = 0.27), with no significant difference.

Evaluate usefulness of grading the severity of gastritis, GIM and the impact of Helicobacter pylori (HP). Define the population at risk for gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) and assess the value of surveillance. Methods: In the course of 19 years, we performed 11,600 sequential EGDs in male veterans at Brooklyn, New York. Of all patients, 47 % had EGD only one time while 53 % had EGD repeated, 11 % of these had four or more EGDs. Patients with GIM were matched with equal number of controls with no Cl symptoms. All gastric biopsies were processed in one laboratory, using the standardized protocol for histological staining and for grading the severity of epithelial changes. Results: Of all patients subjected to EGD, 354 (3.05 %) were diagnosed with GIM. Compared to controls, GIM patients were older, 80 % were over 71. Regarding ethnicity, GIM was 5.4 % more frequent in 177 African Americans than in 159 Caucasians. Distribution of GIM did not differ with respect to age or ethnicity. As many as 6 % of GIM cases were diagnosed with GC. Grading of GIM severity had a predictive value, the average grade of severity in GC was 50 % higher than in non-cancer patients with GIM. Severity of gastritis was also a useful biomarker: patients with GC had more severe gastritis. Surprisingly, HP positivity had no predictive value: HP positive patients had similar distribution of GIM as the HP negative patients. Use of proton pump inhibitors in the past was unknown. Conclusion: Prevalence of GC in patients with GIM was more than 200 times higher than reported in normal population. Age more than 70 years and African Americans appeared to be at higher risk. Routine EGD and histological diagnosis, with simple grading of severity of epithelial changes provides a useful predictive information.

METHODS We performed a comprehensive miRNA array-based approach to compare miRNA expression levels between AFP-positive and AFP-negative cells in three patients with primary AFPGC. We next examined the expression levels of the selected miRNAs in five AFPGC and ten non-AFPGC tissue samples by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to validate their utility. We also investigated the expression levels of the selected miRNA not only in tissue but also in plasma samples. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between plasma AFP levels and plasma selected miRNA expression levels, and also investigated the correlation of the selected miRNA expression levels and malignant potential. RESULTS Among the five miRNAs selected from the miRNA array results, the expression levels of miR-122-5p were significantly higher in the AFPGC patients than in the non-AFPGC patients (P < 0.05). In tissue samples, miR-122-5p expression level tended to be lower in the non-AFPGC tissue than the normal gastric mucosa. Conversely, in the AFPGC tissue, miR-122-5p expression level was significantly higher in the AFPGC tissue than both the normal gastric mucosa and the nonAFPGC tissue samples (P < 0.05). Plasma miR-122-5p expression levels were also significantly higher in the AFPGC patients than the health volunteers and the nonAFPGC patients (P < 0.05) and were strongly correlated with plasma AFP levels (r = 0.7975, P < 0.0001). Moreover, the correlation of miR-122-5p expression in tissue samples with malignant potential was stronger than that of plasma AFP level in the AFPGC patients.

Methods Individuals from the northern region of Portugal, aged between 40 and 79 years, were invited to participate in a blood collection for the determination of serum PG values by ELISA method (Biohit kits). Participants were classified into two groups: positive (PG I <= 70 ng/ml and PG I/PGII <= 3) and negative (all others). All participants with a positive test and a consecutive random sample of participants with a negative test were subjected to endoscopy with biopsy. All the participants (positive or negative) subjected to endoscopy were followed up over 5 years. Results From a total of 13 118 participants, 5326 were men (41%) with a median age of 60 years, and 446 (3.4%) had a positive test. Of these, 274 (61%) were subjected to endoscopy. We observed six gastric cancers, five intestinal and one diffuse type, and three early gastric cancers, representing one cancer per approximately 2200 PG tests or one cancer per 74 positive tests. From these 240 participants with a negative test, three patients with gastric cancer were diagnosed during follow-up (an estimated negative predictive value of 99%). In this study, the PG test showed an estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 67, 47, 2, and 99%, respectively. Conclusion Inhabitants of this high-risk region showed good adherence rate to a gastric cancer detection program based on a PG test followed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy implemented for the first time. Accuracy estimates were similar to those in Japanese reports, indicating that this methodology could also be used effectively in Western countries with high rates of gastric cancer.

METHODS Eighty-three gastric cancer patients were evaluated in this study. Gastric cancer specimens were evaluated for the gene expression of CTAs, Kitakyushu lung cancer antigen-1 (KK-LC-1), melanoma antigen (MAGE)-A1, MAGE-A3 and New York esophageal cancer-1 (NY-ESO-1), by reverse transcription PCR. Clinicopathological background information, such as gender, age, tumor size, macroscopic type, tumor histology, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and pathological stage, was obtained. Statistical comparisons between the expression of each CTA and each clinicopathological background were performed using the chi(2) test. RESULTS The expression rates of KK-LC-1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1 were 79.5%, 32.5%, 39.8%, and 15.7%, respectively. In early stage gastric cancer specimens, the expression of KK-LC-1 was 79.4%, which is comparable to the 79.6% observed in advanced stage specimens. The expression of KK-LC-1 was not significantly associated with clinicopathological factors, while there were considerable differences in the expression rates of MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3 with vs without lymphatic invasion (MAGE-A1, 39.3% vs 13.6%, P = 0.034; MAGE-A3, 47.5% vs 18.2%, P = 0.022) and/or vascular invasion (MAGE-A1, 41.5% vs 16.7%, P = 0.028; MAGE-A3, 49.1% vs 23.3%, P = 0.035) and, particularly, MAGE-A3, in patients with early vs advanced stage (36.5% vs 49.0%, P = 0.044), respectively.

Exosomes play pivotal roles in tumor metastasis through the transfer of microRNAs (miRNAs). We examined the exosomal miRNA profile in peritoneal fluids to identify novel biomarkers to reflect tumor burden in the peritoneum. Methods Exosomes were isolated from peritoneal fluids of patients of gastric cancer with macroscopic (P1) or microscopic (P0CY1) peritoneal metastasis (PM) and comprehensive miRNA expression analysis was carried out. Expressions of candidate miRNAs were then validated in all 58 samples using TaqMan Advanced miRNA Assays. Results In initial screening, we carried out comprehensive analysis of exosomal miRNA using peritoneal fluids from 11 and 14 patients with or without PM, respectively, and identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs in PM (+) samples. Validation analysis showed that four miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-223-3p, and miR-342-3p) were significantly upregulated in 12 PM (+) samples, and their expression levels showed positive correlation with peritoneal cancer index. In contrast, miR-29 family were all downregulated in patients with PM (+) samples. Moreover, in 24 patients with pT4 tumor, miR-29 at gastrectomy tended to be lower in six patients with peritoneal recurrence with significant differences in miR-29b-3p (P = .012).

There is a large debate on natural course of these lesions and surveillance strategy in these patients. This meta-analysis was aimed to find the most appropriate follow up and the rate of progression from IM and GA to GC. Methods This meta-analysis is followed and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Electronic databases including EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science databases, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched until July 2018. Cochran's Q test and I-square (I-2) test were used to examine heterogeneity across included studies. We pooled data using random-effect or fixed effect models indicated as incidence rate or proportion with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The variables of study included demographic data, endoscopy interval, follow up interval and time, GA and IM type and GC stage. Moreover, incidence rate of GC and progress rate, regress and persistence proportion in both GA and IM patients were assessed. Results Overall, 68 original articles out of 32981 citations were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled GC incidence rate in patients with GA was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.80, 1.76; I-2 : 83.6%) cases per 1,000 person-years. The rates of later diagnosis of IM and gastric dysplasia in patients with GA were estimated as 41.42 (95% CI, 3.11, 64.45; I-2 : 95.6%) and 6.23 (95% CI, 2.34, 11.46; I-2 : 83.0%) cases per 1,000 person-years, respectively. The pooled regressed proportion was 32.23 (95% CI, 18.07-48.02; I-2 : 94.0%) and the persistence proportion was 38.83 (95% CI, 20.20-59.13; I-2 : 97.0%) per 100 observations in GA patients. In IM studies, the pooled incidence rate of GC was 3.38 (95% CI, 2.13, 4.85; I-2 : 93.4%) cases per 1,000 person-years. The progressed rate to dysplasia in IM patient was estimated to be 12.51 (95% CI, 5.45, 22.03; I-2 : 95.1%) cases per 1,000 person-years. The pooled regressed proportion was 31.83 (95% CI, 25.48-38.51; I-2 : 91.0%) and the persistence proportion was 43.46 (95% CI, 32.52-54.71; I-2 : 96.0%) per 100 observations in IM patients. Conclusion Overall, the incidence of GC in patients with IM and GA are low but there is heterogeneity in data with the highest rate in Asian, males with those with incomplete IM.

Invasive tests are performed via endoscopic biopsy specimens and these tests include histology, culture, rapid urease test as well as molecular methods. Developments of endoscopic equipment also contribute to the real-time diagnosis of H. pylori during endoscopy. Urea breathing test and stool antigen test are most widely used non-invasive tests, whereas serology is useful in screening and epidemiological studies. Molecular methods have been used in variable specimens other than gastric mucosa. More than detection of H. pylori infection, several tests are introduced into the evaluation of virulence factors and antibiotic sensitivity of H. pylori, as well as screening precancerous lesions and gastric cancer.

The expression of Smac, a known inhibitor of XIAP, was found to be elevated during CBD treatment. Moreover, CBD treatment increased the interaction between XIAP and Smac by increasing Smac release from mitochondria to the cytosol. CBD has also been shown to affect mitochondrial dysfunction.

However, it did not completely prevent the onset of latent gastric cancer among those at high risk (i.e., with atrophic gastritis). To prevent deaths from gastric cancer, it is necessary to eradicate H. pylori infection. We propose a program of risk stratification based on the presence of H. pylori infection with or without atrophic gastritis followed by targeted interventions. Those at no risk for gastric cancer (no H. pylori, no atrophic gastritis) need no therapy or follow-up. Those at low risk (H. pylori infected, nonatrophic gastritis) need only H. pylori eradication therapy. The smaller groups at high or very high risk need eradication and cancer surveillance. We estimated the costs and the benefits of this strategy. Gastric cancer screening by simultaneous measurement of serum pepsinogen and H. pylori antibody combined with eradication of H. pylori in all individuals at risk would initially increase national healthcare expenditure, but this would be offset by markedly reducing the cost of treating gastric cancer. The proposed strategy should prevent about 150,000 deaths from gastric cancer during the 5 years after its adoption. If the loss caused by these deaths is also taken into account, the economic effect of this strategy becomes enormous. It would probably reduce the incidence of gastric cancer by more than 80-90% within 10 years. The Japanese government should take the initiative to implement this strategy as soon as possible.",Dec-10,2025/4/23 17:57,2025/4/23 20:18,,486-490,,6,15,,Helicobacter,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of science,,Num Pages: 5 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000284271800001,,,,HELICOBACTER-PYLORI INFECTION; ERADICATION; Helicobacter pylori; SERUM PEPSINOGEN; GUIDELINES; cost-effectiveness; gastric cancer prevention; eradication; 1160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, it has been demonstrated that serum pepsinogens (PGs), and gastrin 17 (G17) are useful for screening individuals at elevated risk to develop atrophic gastritis but they are suboptimal biomarkers to screen individuals for GC. The main purpose of this study was to investigate serum metabolomic profiles to find additional biomarkers that could be integrated with serum PGs and G17 to improve the diagnosis of GC and the selection of first-degree relatives (FDR) at higher risk of GC development. Serum metabolomic profiles included 188 serum metabolites, covering amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and hexoses. Serum metabolomic profiles were performed with tandem mass spectrometry using the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit. The initial cohort (training set) consisted of n = 49 GC patients and n = 37 FDR. Differential metabolomic signatures among the two groups were investigated by univariate and multivariate partial least square differential analysis. The most significant metabolites were further selected and validated in an independent group of n = 22 GC patients and n = 17 FDR (validation set). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic power and the optimal cut-off for each of the discriminant markers. Multivariate analysis was applied to associate the selected serum metabolites, PGs, G17 and risk factors such as age, gender and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection with the GC and FDR has been performed and an integrative risk prediction algorithm was developed. In the training set, 40 metabolites mainly belonging to phospholipids and acylcarnitines classes were differentially expressed between GC and FDR. Out of these 40 metabolites, 9 were further confirmed in the validation set. Compared with FDR, GC patients were characterized by lower levels of hydroxylated sphingomyelins (SM(OH)22:1, SM(OH)22:2, SM(OH)24:1) and phosphatidylcholines (PC ae 40:1, PC ae 42:2, PC ae 42:3) and by higher levels of acylcarnitines derivatives (C2, C16, C18:1). The specificity and sensitivity of the integrative risk prediction analysis of metabolites for GC was 73.47% and 83.78% respectively with an area under the curve of the ROC curve of 0.811 that improves to 0.90 when metabolites were integrated with the serum PGs.

Parts per billion (ppb)-level detection is achieved based on color changes of the array. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis of the exhaled gas from GC patients and healthy candidates indicated 25 different VOCs which may be used as the biomarkers. The paper-based smartphone nano-optoelectronic nose, used in combination with orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), was able to differentiate between VOCs associated with GC patients and healthy candidates with an accuracy of 90 %.

The signal amplification strategy, using the synergetic effect present in PtPd-Fe3O4 to increase the reduction ability of the NPs toward H2O2, improved the sensitivity of the immunosensor. The immunosensor was constructed by modifying glassy carbon electrode with reduced graphene oxide-tetraethylene pentamine (rGO-TEPA) for effective immobilization of primary anti-CA72-4 antibody (Ab(1)). Secondary anti-CA72-4 antibody (Ab(2)) was adsorbed onto the PtPd-Fe3O4 NPs. The proposed immunosensor displayed a wide linear range (0.001-10 U/mL) with the low detection limit (0.0003 U/mL). The immunosensor was evaluated for serum samples, receiving satisfactory results. Therefore, the immunosensor possesses excellent clinical value in cancer screening as well as convenient point-of-care diagnostics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In Japan, this ""ABC method"" is considered an effective means of stratifying gastric cancer risk. This study aimed to ascertain its cost-effectiveness for assessing gastric cancer risk. A Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of two strategies for gastric cancer-risk screening over a 30-year period: the ABC method, which uses a combination of assessing the presence of HPA and measuring serum PG concentrations and scheduling endoscopies accordingly, and annual endoscopic screening. Clinical and epidemiological data on variables in the model were obtained from published reports. Analyses were made from the perspective of the Japanese health care payer. According to base-case analysis, the ABC method cost less than annual endoscopic screening (64,489 vs. 64,074 USD) and saved more lives (18.16 vs. 18.30 quality-adjusted life years). One-way analyses confirmed the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. The probability that the ABC method is cost-effective in Japanese individuals aged 50 years was 0.997.

In addition, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a 20-mm-sized, slightly non-uniform hypoechoic mass in the submucosa. Since the diagnosis could not be confirmed by mucosal biopsy, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was performed.

The structure was positive on Congo red staining, and green polarized light was also observed under a polarizing microscope. Moreover, it was resistant to potassium permanganate reaction, negative for serum amyloid A protein, positive for anti-lambda chain antibody, and negative for anti-kappa chain, anti-amyloid A, anti-transthyretin, and anti-beta 2-microglobulin antibodies. Therefore, the lesion was diagnosed as AL-lambda-type amyloidosis. No systemic amyloidosis findings were found; thus, the patient was finally diagnosed with localized gastric AL amyloidosis.

In this study, we sought to assess the epidemiology of GC, its clinicopathological profiles, and its association with risk factors as well as to identify premalignant gastric lesions (PGL) and examine neoplastic progression. (2) Methods: This five-year prospective study screened for GC and PGL in asymptomatic Saudi patients, aged 45-75 years (n = 35,640) and living in Al Kharj, Riyadh province in central SA. Those who were positive in a high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (HSgFOBT+) and had negative results in colonoscopy offered to undergo upper GI endoscopy (n = 1242). Factors associated with GC were examined. (3) Results: The five-year participation rate was 87% (1080/1242). The incidence rate of GC was 26.9 new cases per 100,000 population per year (9.6 new cases per year/total population at risk-35,640), and it was 8.9 cases per 1000 persons per year among the 1080 subjects with HSgFOBT+ and negative colonoscopy results.
